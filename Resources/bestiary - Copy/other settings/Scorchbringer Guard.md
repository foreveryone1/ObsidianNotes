>***Explosive Tank.*** When the guard dies, or if it rolls a 1 when checking whether its Scorchbringer action recharges, the tank on its back explodes in a 10-foot radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the scorchbringer.

While chemisters focus on inventing new tools, weapons, and other devices for the guild to use, the role of a blastseeker is to put those devices to work. Despite the name, not all such devices produce explosions, but all the most interesting ones (from the Izzet perspective) do.
