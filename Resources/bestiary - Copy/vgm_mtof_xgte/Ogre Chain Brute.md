## Ogre Chain Brute
*Vile and violent though they be, ogres prove to be tractable minions for those unafraid to be brutal masters. I prefer giants, however.*— Mordenkainen***Ogre Chain Brute.*** An ogre chain brute wields a great spiked chain. It swings this chain with both hands in a wide circle around itself to knock foes off their feet. Alternatively, it can swing the chain in a crushing overhead smash that's nearly impossible to block or deflect.
***Ogres.*** Ogres are infamously dim-witted, but with enough time and patience, some of them can be trained to carry out specialized missions in battle. The names they are given—the battering ram, the bolt launcher, the chain brute, and the howdah—reflect their particular functions. These jobs are simple, but they're tailored to take advantage of an ogre's strengths.
