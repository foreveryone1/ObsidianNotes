>
>At will: alter self, major image  
>3/day each: charm person, detect thoughts, fear  
>1/day each: confusion, dominate person, mass suggestion  
>
>
>***Magic Resistance.*** The abishai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  
>
>***Magic Weapons.*** The abishai's weapon attacks are magical.  
>
>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The abishai makes two attacks, one with its claws and one with its longsword, or it casts one spell from its Innate Spellcasting trait and makes one claw attack.  
>
>***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage, or 6 (1d10 + 1) slashing damage if used with two hands.  
>
>***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
## Green Abishai
***Green Abishai.*** The envoys of Tiamat's armies, green abishais represent the god's interests in the Nine Hells and beyond. Their keen senses make them adept at discovering secrets and other sensitive information, while their diplomatic skills and their magic ensure that they can manipulate even the shrewdest opponents.
***Abishai.*** Each abishai was once a mortal who somehow won Tiamat's favor before death and, as a reward, found its soul transformed into a hideous devil to serve at her pleasure in the Nine Hells.
***Emissaries of Doom.*** Tiamat deploys abishais as emissaries, sending them to represent her interests in the Hells and across the multiverse. Some have simple tasks, such as delivering a message to cultists or taking charge of worshipers to carry out a sensitive mission. Others have greater responsibilities, such as leading large groups, assassinating targets, and serving in armies. In all cases, abishais are fanatically loyal to Tiamat, ready to lay down their lives if needed.
***Outsiders in Hell.*** Abishais stand outside the normal hierarchy of the Nine Hells, having their own chain of command and ultimately answering to Tiamat (and Asmodeus, when the dark lord chooses to use them). Other archdevils can command abishais to work for them, but most archdevils do so rarely, since it is never clear whether an abishai follows Tiamat's orders or Asmodeus's.
There is inherent risk in countermanding an order given by Tiamat, but interfering with Asmodeus's plans invites certain destruction.
*Tiamat is a force of Chaos bound to a place of Law. Are abishai her servants or her jailers?*â€” Mordenkainen
