## Duergar Mind Master
*Absence of light results in darkness. So, what results from the absence of Good? The underdark is a place with very little of either.****Duergar Mind Master.*** The feared duergar mind masters usually operate as spies, both inside and beyond a duergar stronghold. Their psionically augmented abilities enable them to see through illusions with ease and shrink down to miniature size to spy on their targets.
