## Ankylosaurus Zombie
Several new zombie variants are presented below. For more information on zombies, see the Monster Manual.
***Ankylosaurus Zombie.*** This creature is slow and barely aware of its surroundings.
***Girallon Zombie.*** Girallons are four-armed apes with white fur. Girallon zombies are slower than their non-undead counterparts but no less fierce. The necromantic energy empowering them fuels their murderous hearts and their hunger for living flesh.
***Tyrannosaurus Zombie.*** A tyrannosaurus zombie has a gullet full of smaller zombies, which it can disgorge. These zombies aren't under the tyrannosaurus zombie's control.
