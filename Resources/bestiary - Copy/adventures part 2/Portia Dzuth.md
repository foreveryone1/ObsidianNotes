>***Indomitable (2/Day).*** Portia rerolls a failed saving throw.

>***Second Wind (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** As a bonus action, Portia can regain 20 hit points.  
>
>***Shadowfell Despair.*** Portia suffers from Shadowfell despair manifesting as unshakable dread. Until the despair ends, she has disadvantage on all saving throws and gains the following flaw: "I'm convinced that I'm going to die in Vanrakdoom." Portia can attempt to end her despair each time she finishes a long rest, doing so with a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. A calm emotions spell also ends her despair, as does any spell or other magical effect that removes a curse.
