## Vanifer
Vanifer's rough childhood has hardened her heart against others. The world is a corrupt, painful place, she thinks, and deserving of a fiery end. For years, she was a dancer and concubine in a pasha's court in Calimshan. Later, she took up the mantle of prophet when she found Tinderstrike, and the same ruthless ambition and practiced manipulation that enabled her to escape a life of servitude serves her well as the head of a growing cult.
For Vanifer, battle is best observed at a distance. She prefers to hurl destructive magic from afar. Those who challenge Vanifer in melee learn a painful lesson, as she and Tinderstrike make a formidable pair.
In the Fire Node
When enemies threaten the Temple of Eternal Flame, Vanifer withdraws to the Weeping Colossus, the fire node. Within this node, Vanifer gains one additional use of her Legendary Resistance trait.
#### Lair Actions
If Vanifer is in the fire node while Imix isn't, the tiefling can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Vanifer uses a lair action to cast one of her spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. She can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, although she can continue to concentrate on a spell she previously cast using a lair action. Vanifer can take no other lair actions while concentrating on a spell cast as a lair action. Her favorite use of this capability is casting fireball or hypnotic pattern.
If Vanifer casts misty step using this lair action, she also draws the power of the fire node into herself. By doing so, she regains 15 (3d8 + 2) hit points.
