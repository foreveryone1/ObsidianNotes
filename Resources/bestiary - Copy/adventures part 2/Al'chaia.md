>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** Al'chaia makes two silver greatsword attacks.  
>
>***Silver Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) psychic damage. This is a magic weapon attack. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the astral projection spell), Al'chaia can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
