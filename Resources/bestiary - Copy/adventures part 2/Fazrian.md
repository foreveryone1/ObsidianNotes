## Fazrian
Once an exemplar of courage and good judgment, Fazrian now seeks to destroy any creature it believes is undeserving of continued existence. Fazrian's views are a mockery of what they once were. Every creature is guilty of "deformity" in the planetar's eyes. Unless someone can swiftly prove their innocence, Fazrian sentences that individual to an immediate death.
#### Lair Actions
Unless he is incapacitated, Fazrian can take one of the following lair actions on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties) while on the Terminus Level:
- Blood flows from Fazrian's eyes until initiative count 20 on the next round. No creature within 120 feet of the planetar can regain hit points until the effect ends.
- Fazrian's eyes become smoldering black voids until initiative count 20 on the next round. All other creatures within 120 feet of the planetar have disadvantage on saving throws until the effect ends.
- Blinding magical light springs from Fazrian's eyes until initiative count 20 on the next round. If a creature starts its turn within 120 feet of the planetar and the two of them can see each other, Fazrian can force the creature to make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. The blindness lasts until the creature receives a lesser restoration spell or similar magic.
