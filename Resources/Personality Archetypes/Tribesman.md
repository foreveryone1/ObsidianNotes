- I'm driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.
- I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.
- I once ran twenty-five miles without stopping to warn to my clan of an approaching orc horde. I'd do it again if I had to.
- I have a lesson for every situation, drawn from observing nature.
- I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won't save you from a hungry owlbear.
- I'm always picking things up, absently fiddling with them, and sometimes accidentally breaking them.
- I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.
- I was, in fact, raised by wolves.
- Don't tell me I'm not allowed to do something.
- Unlike people, the beasts of the wild are friends who won't stab me in the back.
### Ideals
- Change: Life is like the seasons, in constant change, and we must change with it. #Chaotic
- Greater Good: It is each person's responsibility to make the most happiness for the whole tribe. #Good
- Honor: If I dishonor myself, I dishonor my whole clan. #Lawful
- Might: The strongest are meant to rule. #Evil
- Nature: The natural world is more important than all the constructs of civilization. #Neutral
- Glory: I must earn glory in battle, for myself and my clan.

### Bonds
- My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me.
- An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.
- I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland.
- I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend.
- I am devoted to a sacred site in the midst of rubble.
- I suffer awful visions of a coming disaster and will do anything to prevent it.
- It is my duty to provide children to sustain my tribe.
- I would give my life for my clan chieftain.
### Flaws
- I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.
- There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.
- I remember every insult I've received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who's ever wronged me.
- I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.
- Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.
- Don't expect me to save those who can't save themselves. It is nature's way that the strong thrive and the weak perish.
- If you question my courage, I will never back down.
- I'm so convinced of my superiority over soft, civilized people that I'll take great risks to prove it.
