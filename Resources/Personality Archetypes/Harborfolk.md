### Traits
- I am curious. I want to know why things are the way they are and why people do the things that they do.
- I can't sing, but that never stops me from doing it, loudly. Everyone loves a good sea chanty!
- I think the LOCAL LORD is doing a terrific job, don't you?

- I have a sea story to fit every occasion.
- I'm a fisher, but I secretly detest eating fish. I will do anything to avoid it.
### Ideals
- Calm: For all things, there is a tide. I set sail when it is right, and mend my nets when it is not. #Lawful
- Windblown: I go where the winds blow. No man or woman tells me where or when to sail. #Chaotic
- Aspiring: I will gain the favor of a wealthy patron!
- Salty: I want people to look to me as an expert on cutting a deal in the harbor..
- Selfless: We are all children of the sea. I help everyone in peril afloat and ashore. #Good

### Bonds

### Flaws

- I killed a drunk member of the City Watch in a brawl. I am terrified that they might find out.
