Nature offers rich and abundant metaphors for understanding the complexities of life.

### Bonds
I would give my life in the defense of the small enclave where I first found my faith.
I love beasts and plants of all kinds, and am loath to harm them.

I enjoy comfort and quiet, and prefer to avoid extra effort.
I have a fierce temper that doesn't reflect the inner calm I seek.
I'm convinced that everyone else in the conclave has a deeper connection to their faith than I do.
I'm trying to atone for the life of crime I led before I joined the faith, but I find it hard to give up my bad habits.
