### Ideals
- Respect: Everybody, no matter their riches, deserves respect. #Good

- I will never completely trust another. I only trust myself.
- I would rather use an unfair advantage than fight honorably.
- It's not theft if I have more use for it than someone else.
- People who are incapable of taking care of themselves get what they deserve.
