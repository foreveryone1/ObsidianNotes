### Traits
- I have a hard time staying focused on ... oh, and my brain tends to jump from one ... did I mention focus?
- I get really excited about my ideas and I can't wait to talk about them and start putting them into practice and tinkering with them and I want to tell you about how exciting it all is!
- It's not magic-or anything, really-if you do it only halfway. Whatever I do, I give it all I've got.
- I do what my gut tells me.
- Life's an experiment, and I can't wait to see what happens.
- I pepper my speech with the incomprehensible jargon of my trade, like mizzium droplets inserted into a weird-field suspension.
- Great ideas are fine, but great results are what counts.
- If you can guess what I'm about to do, that means I've run out of imagination.
### Ideals
- Guild: My guild is all that really matters.
- All life is meant to progress toward perfection, and our work is to hurry it along-no matter what must be upended along the way. #Chaotic
- Creativity: Half the world's troubles come from stodgy thinking, stuck in the past. We need innovative solutions. #Chaotic
- Discovery: Every experiment has the potential to reveal more secrets of the multiverse. 
- Science: A rigorous application of logical principles and protocols will lead us toward progress more surely than any belief system. #Lawful
- Logic: It's foolish to let emotions and principles interfere with the conclusions of logic. #Lawful
- Fun: I love my job! Despite the dangerous working conditions, there's nothing I'd rather do. #Chaotic
- Superiority: My vast intellect and strength are directed toward increasing my sway over others. #Evil
- Power: Someday I'll find or create the magic that will make me the most powerful being in REGION. #Evil
### Bonds
- I have dedicated my life to finding a solution to a scientific problem.
- I'll never forget the laboratory where I learned my skills, or the other attendants who learned alongside me.
- I'm convinced it was sabotage that destroyed my first laboratory and killed many of my friends, and I seek revenge against whoever did it.
- I have the schematics for an invention that I hope to build one day, once I have the necessary resources.
- A fellow student and I are racing to solve the same scientific puzzle.
- I would do anything the guildmaster told me to do.
### Flaws
- If there's a plan, I'll probably forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll probably ignore it.
- I get bored easily, and if nothing is happening I'll make something happen.
- Nothing is ever simple, and if it seems simple, I'll find a way to make it complicated.
- I tend to ignore sleep for days when I'm conducting research, often at the expense of my own health and safety.
- I'm convinced there's not a soul in who can match my boundless intellect.
- I'm incapable of admitting a flaw in my logic.
- Every social situation I'm in seems to lead to my asking rude personal questions.
- I'll take any risk to earn recognition for my scientific brilliance.
