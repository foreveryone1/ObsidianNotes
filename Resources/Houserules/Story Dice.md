## Basic Mechanic
A number of story dice equal to the number of players plus one is always present in the game.

When a player expends a story die, that story die is transferred to the dungeon master, inversely, the DM can expend a story die, which is then transferred to the players' pool of story dice.

The dungeon master adjudicates when a story die can be used. Typically, story dice cannot effect situations where the player expending a story die has no influence over the outcome of a situation.

Using a story die to force an opponent to reroll a critical strike is possible, but using a story die to make the dungeon master reroll the outcome of an event miles away isn't possible, barring narrative justification.

## Uses
### Reroll
A story die can be expended to roll a d20 again, using that result. If a roll was made with advantage disadvantage, the rerolled die may choose which result the newly rolled die replaces. Afterwards, the rules of advantage or disadvantage are still applied to choose between the results.
