## Strength
The DM might call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
-   Break free of bonds
-   Push through a tunnel that is too small
-   Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
-   Tip over a statue
-   Keep a boulder from rolling
