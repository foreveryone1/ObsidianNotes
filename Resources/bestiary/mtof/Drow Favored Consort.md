## Drow Favored Consort

*Many creatures enjoy torture, but the dark elves have made it into an exquisite art.*â€” Mordenkainen***Drow Favored Consort.*** Nearly all priestesses of Lolth, including the powerful matron mothers, take attractive drow as their consorts. Often these individuals serve no purpose beyond pleasure, breeding, or both, but sometimes consorts can gain the ear of their priestess and be relied on to provide useful advice. No position of consort is assured for long; priestesses are infamous for being fickle with their favor, which are they are especially glad to lavish on a consort who combines beauty with magical might.
