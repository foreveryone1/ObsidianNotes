## The Lost

***The Lost.*** The Shadowfell turns visitors around until they become marooned in its twisted landscape. The Lost are representations of the anxiety and fear that people experience when they can't find their way. These sorrowsworn appear as desperate and panicked things.

The Lost try to embrace any creatures they can reach, attempting to find solace in the contact. Aside from the horror of being embraced by such a thing, the victim experiences a flood of fear and panic as its mind buckles under the fury of this assault. The harder the victims' allies fight for release, the worse the experience becomes.

***Sorrowsworn.*** The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. The sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering that are inherent to the shadowy landscape, and they visit horror on those who stumble into their midst.

***Emotion Given Form.*** Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress. Some are manifestations of anger; others are loneliness given physical form. Their nature provides a clue both to understanding how they become more powerful and to overcoming them. Giving in to the negative emotions that the sorrowsworn represent causes these entities to grow deadlier. Fighting against these emotions can weaken them and drive them away.
