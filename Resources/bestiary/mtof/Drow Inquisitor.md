## Drow Inquisitor

*Drow mages can be quite learned and skilled in magic. Some of them can even cast my spells.*â€” Mordenkainen***Drow Inquisitor.*** Drow expect treachery. After all, the Spider Queen encourages it. A certain amount of backstabbing and double-crossing can be managed, but too much can undermine an entire community. To keep some semblance of order and to root out traitors, drow priestesses employ inquisitors. Chosen from the ranks of the priesthood, these female drow possess authority equaled only by the matrons of the noble houses. Anyone they decide is at odds with the hierarchy faces torture and usually an excruciating death.
