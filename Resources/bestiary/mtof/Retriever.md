>***Faultless Tracker.*** The retriever is given a quarry by its master. The quarry can be a specific creature or object the master is personally acquainted with, or it can be a general type of creature or object the master has seen before. The retriever knows the direction and distance to its quarry as long as the two of them are on the same plane of existence. The retriever can have only one such quarry at a time. The retriever also always knows the location of its master.

## Retriever

***Retriever.*** The retriever is a potent, spider-like construct conceived and built by the drow for one original purpose—to prowl the Abyss and capture demons for the drow to enslave or use in their rituals. The automatons proved so effective and so fearsome that they now perform many different missions.

***Demon-Infused.*** Although each retriever is a metal-and-magic construct, it houses the imprisoned spirit of a bebilith. Most of the demon's intellect has been distilled away, leaving only its cruelty and cunning.

***Lethal Collectors.*** Though they were created to operate only in the Abyss, retrievers are sometimes dispatched when a powerful drow needs some creature or object captured and brought back alive and intact. Only under the rarest of circumstances is a retriever handed over or sold to a non-drow, since the dark elves don't want to take the chance that the construct will be turned against them.
