## The Wretched

***The Wretched.*** Horrid little monsters, the Wretched gather in large packs to scour the Shadowfell for prey. These pitiful entities subsist on life force, so when they find a creature, they surge forward to sink their fangs into their victims and drink deep of their life energy and their fear.

***Sorrowsworn.*** The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. The sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering that are inherent to the shadowy landscape, and they visit horror on those who stumble into their midst.

***Emotion Given Form.*** Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress. Some are manifestations of anger; others are loneliness given physical form. Their nature provides a clue both to understanding how they become more powerful and to overcoming them. Giving in to the negative emotions that the sorrowsworn represent causes these entities to grow deadlier. Fighting against these emotions can weaken them and drive them away.
