>***Antimagic Susceptibility.*** The broom is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the broom must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.  
>
>***Constructed Nature.*** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.  
>The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.  
>
>***False Appearance.*** While the broom remains motionless and isn't flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal broom.  
>
## Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The broom makes two melee attacks.  
>
>***Broomstick.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage.  
>
>### Reactions
>***Animated Attack.*** If the broom is motionless and a creature grabs hold of it, the broom makes a Dexterity check contested by the creature's Strength check. If the broom wins the contest, it flies out of the creature's grasp and makes a melee attack against it with advantage on the attack roll.
## Broom of Animated Attack
A broom of animated attack is easily mistaken for a broom of flying. It attacks any creature that grabs it or tries to ride it.
***Flying Broom.*** Some brooms of animated attack allow their creators to ride them, in which case they behave like typical brooms of flying. A broom of animated attack, however, can carry only half the weight that a broom of flying can (see chapter 7, "Treasure," of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
