## Living Blade of Disaster
A living blade of disaster is a blade of disaster spell (see appendix D) with a wicked will of its own. It looks like a floating, black planar rift in the shape of a sword. Like a demon, it craves destruction.
Areas of wild magic and sites that have been ravaged by powerful eldritch forces can give rise to spell effects that become living beings. These so-called living spells haunt the places where they were created, subsisting on ambient magical energy.
