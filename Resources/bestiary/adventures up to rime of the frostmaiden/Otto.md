## Actions
>***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 2d6 + 4 piercing damage.  
>
>***Euphoria Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The dragon exhales a puff of euphoria gas at one creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can't take reactions and must roll a d6 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior during the turn:  
>1–4. The target takes no action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.  
>5–6. The target doesn't move, and the only thing it can do on its turn is make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
