## Nezznar the Black Spider
Drow (dark elves) are a devious, scheming subterranean race that worships Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders.
Drow society is strictly matriarchal. Male drow are relegated to servitor roles, and while most train as warriors, a few, such as Nezznar, become skilled wizards.
