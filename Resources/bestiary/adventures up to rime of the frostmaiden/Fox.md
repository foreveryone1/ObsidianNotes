## Fox
The white arctic foxes of Icewind Dale live in burrows and are acclimated to cold weather. They prowl the outskirts of Ten-Towns and nearby forests for food, hunting hares or stealing fish. These timid creatures avoid contact with humanoids, but they are sometimes used as mounts by chwingas.
