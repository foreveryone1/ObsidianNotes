## Legendary Actions
>Ogrémoch can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Ogrémoch regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
>- **Illuminating Crystals.** Ogrémoch's crystalline protrusions flare. Each creature within 30 feet of Ogrémoch becomes outlined in orange light, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius. Any attack roll against an affected creature has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature can't benefit from being invisible.
>- **Stomp (Costs 2 Actions).** Ogrémoch stomps the ground, creating an earth tremor that extends in a 30-foot radius. Other creatures standing on the ground in that radius must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
>- **Create Gargoyle (Costs 3 Actions).** Ogrémoch's hit points are reduced by 50 as he breaks off a chunk of his body and places it on the ground in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of him. The chunk of rock instantly transforms into a gargoyle and acts on the same initiative count as Ogrémoch. Ogrémoch can't use this action if he has 50 hit points or fewer. The gargoyle obeys Ogrémoch's commands and fights until destroyed.
## Ogrémoch
The Prince of Evil Earth is Ogremoch (pronounced oh-gray-mock), the Mountain that Walks. His natural form is a shambling, 50-foot-tall colossus of rock, with crystal growths embedded throughout his body. When he bothers to speak, his voice sounds like grinding stones.
Ogremoch is a miser who regards all the resources and treasures found in the ground as his own. He holds nothing but contempt for mortals (or any other denizens of the Material Plane) and desires nothing more than to crush and subjugate whomever he encounters. What he can't crush, he endures and outlasts.
Ogremoch especially resents any mortals that dare to remove valuable metal or stone from the earth, and those who shape or build things of stone. He notices each nugget of gold or raw gemstone removed from areas under his influence, seeking to reclaim treasures "stolen" from him-and to punish the thieves. When the Prince of Evil Earth gains access to the Material Plane through an elemental node, he begins to methodically locate and destroy every mine, quarry, town, or fortification in the area. It's not that he needs the wealth, but the principle of the thing-extracting treasure from the earth-is anathema to Ogremoch.
***Ogremoch's Lair.*** Ogremoch is normally found in the depths of elemental earth, choosing caverns with black crystals and jagged rock spikes to serve as his throne room. He can enter the Material Plane through large and well-established nodes of elemental earth, with a little help from the proper rituals. Within such a node, Ogremoch wields great power.
## Lair Actions
Ogrémoch can assert his dominion over the rock and stone around him to take lair actions on the Elemental Plane of Earth, or in any elemental earth node (including the Black Geode, described in chapter 5). On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Ogrémoch uses his lair action to cause one of the following effects:
- A 10-foot-radius area of rocky or earthy ground within 60 feet of Ogrémoch turns to sticky mud. Any creature on the ground in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink 5 feet into the mud and be restrained. A creature can take an action to make a DC 15 Strength check, ending the effect on itself or another creature within its reach on a success.
- Crystalline spikes grow from the ground in a 20-foot-radius area within 60 feet of Ogrémoch. The area becomes difficult terrain. A creature that moves through the affected area takes 1d8 piercing damage for every 5 feet it moves there. Creatures that are knocked prone in the area also take this damage.
- A violent tremor shakes the lair in a 120-foot-radius around Ogrémoch. Each creature other than Ogrémoch on the ground in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone.
#### Regional Effects
The region containing an elemental node in which Ogrémoch is present is seriously affected, becoming geologically unstable. This creates the following effects:
- Earth tremors strike the region within 10 miles of Ogrémoch's location every 2d12 hours, each lasting 1d10 rounds. At first, damage is minor—broken windows, cracked plaster, items toppled off shelves. The longer Ogrémoch remains, the stronger the tremors become. After 5 days, the tremors are strong enough to destroy flimsy structures. After 10 days, they are strong enough to destroy ordinary wooden buildings. After 20 days, they can seriously damage or destroy reinforced or fortified structures.
- Magnetic disturbances within 10 miles of Ogrémoch prevent compasses from functioning there.
- Hidden sinkholes and fissures form within 1 mile of Ogrémoch's location. A hidden sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance by any creature with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 15 or higher or spotted with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 × 10 feet into the sinkhole or fissure.
- Natural caves and tunnels within 1 mile of Ogrémoch's lair form intermittent portals to the Elemental Plane of Earth, allowing elemental creatures into the mortal world to dwell near those points.
If Ogrémoch is destroyed or banished back to his home plane, the regional effects fade over the next 1d10 days.
