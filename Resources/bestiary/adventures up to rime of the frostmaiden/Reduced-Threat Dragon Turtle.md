## Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.  
>
>***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (3d12 + 7) piercing damage.  
>
>***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage.  
>
>***Steam Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).*** The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
