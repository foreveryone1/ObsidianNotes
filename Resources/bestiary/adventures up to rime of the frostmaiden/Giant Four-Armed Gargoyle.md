## Giant Four-Armed Gargoyle
Only Acererak knows the secret of creating these creatures. A giant four-armed gargoyle stands 8 to 9 feet tall and weighs roughly five thousand pounds. It is typically employed as a tomb guardian, rending intruders with its fangs and deadly claws. For more information on gargoyles, see the Monster Manual.
