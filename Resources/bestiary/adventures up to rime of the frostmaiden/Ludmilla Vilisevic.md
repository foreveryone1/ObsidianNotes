## Actions
>***Multiattack.*** Ludmilla makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.  
>
>***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Ludmilla, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Ludmilla regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

>***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, Ludmilla can grapple the target (escape DC 13).
