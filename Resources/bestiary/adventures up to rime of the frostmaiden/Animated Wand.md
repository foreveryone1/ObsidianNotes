>***Animated.*** If the wand lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the wand is securely attached to a surface or larger wand, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0.  
>When the animated wand drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original wand form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original wand form.  
>The DM might rule that a specific wands slam attack inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.  
>
## Actions
>***Wand of Wonder.*** The animated wand can expend 1 of its charges and target a random creature with one of its randomly determined effects. Any such effect that would target the wand's user targets the wand instead. If reduced to 0 hit points, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.  
>
>***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
