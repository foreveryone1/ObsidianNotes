## Giant Coral Snake
Comfortable on land or in water, these brilliantly colored snakes are renowned for their potent and hallucinogenic venom. They are most often found in coastal caves. In the abandoned chambers of the hermitage in Tammeraut's Fate, these giant serpents feed on any creature that crosses their path.
