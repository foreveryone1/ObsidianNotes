>### Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The tri-flower frond uses its orange blossom, then its yellow blossom, and then its red blossom.  
>
>***Orange Blossom.*** The tri-flower frond chooses one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in this way, the target is unconscious. At the end of each minute, the poisoned target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
>
>***Yellow Blossom.*** The tri-flower frond chooses one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, or it is covered with corrosive sap and takes 5 acid damage at the start of each of its turns. Dousing the target with water reduces the acid damage by 1 point per pint or flask of water used.  
>
>***Red Blossom.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 2 (1d4) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the target takes 5 (2d4) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The red blossom can grapple only one target at a time. Another creature within reach of the tri-flower frond can use its action to end the grapple on the target.
## Tri-flower Frond
When fully grown, a tri-flower frond stands 6 to 7 feet tall. It has three bright, trumpet-shaped flowers, each as large as a human head and each one a different color: intense red, vivid orange, and bright yellow. Each flower can harm a creature in a different terrible way.
