>***Roleplaying Information.*** Orlekto is in love with Princess Mirran and wants to see her become Queen of the Wyrmskull Throne. (If Mirran is dead, Orlekto aims to avenge her.) If the opportunity to eliminate Hekaton or Serissa presents itself, Orlekto seizes it. Until then, he conceals his treacherous nature.  
>Ideal: "Storm giants should rule the world. Weak leaders have let dragons and others steal what the gods gave to us!"  
>Bond: "I serve Princess Mirran and her alone."  
>Flaw: "For Mirran's love or my revenge, I'd betray my king and my honor."
