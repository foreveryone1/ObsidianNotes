>***Amphibious.*** Tromokratis can breathe air and water.  
>
>***Hearts of the Kraken (Mythic Trait; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** When Tromokratis is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, the damage creates cracks in its carapace, revealing its hearts. Tromokratis has four hearts: two on its chest, one on its back, and one at the base of its tail. A heart has an AC of 22 and 100 hit points. It is immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and it is immune to all conditions. If it is forced to make a saving throw, treat its ability scores as 10 (+0). If it finishes a short or long rest, the carapace heals, any destroyed hearts regenerate, and the hearts are covered again. Tromokratis dies when all the hearts are destroyed.

>***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Tromokratis fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  
>
>***Magic Weapons.*** Tromokratis's weapon attacks are magical.  
>
>***Siege Monster.*** Tromokratis deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Actions
>***Multiattack.*** Tromokratis makes three attacks: one with its pincer, one with its tail, and one with its tentacle grasp.  
>
>***Pincer.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 26). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained, and Tromokratis can't use this attack on anyone else.  
>
>***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 23 (3d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a creature, it is knocked prone.  
>
>***Tentacle Grasp.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. Hit: 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 26). If the target doesn't escape by the end of its next turn, Tromokratis throws the target up to 60 feet in a straight line. The target lands prone and takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage.  
>
>***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +18 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 29 (3d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by Tromokratis, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside Tromokratis, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of Tromokratis's turns. If Tromokratis takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, Tromokratis must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of Tromokratis. If Tromokratis dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

## Tromokratis
Most krakens roam the seas, shattering hulls and scattering fleets, but the kraken Tromokratis notoriously vents its wrath on coastal settlements. Whether it acts at the command of the god Thassa or to sate its own hunger, Tromokratis numbers among the most feared threats in the sea, having no fixed lair and wandering where it will. In recent memory, the massive menace rose from the waves to topple the Pyrgnos, Meletis's great repository of scholarly knowledge. Since that day, the polis keeps a watch specifically for Tromokratis.
#### Tromokratis as a Mythic Encounter
Tromokratis numbers among the most powerful creatures a group of adventurers might face. If you wish to make an encounter with the kraken truly legendary, Tromokratis might use its Hearts of the Kraken mythic trait. When this happens, it calls upon a reserve of strength just as it appears to be vanquished. After its hearts are exposed, Tromokratis can choose one of its mythic actions when it uses a legendary action.
Read or paraphrase the following text when Tromokratis uses its Hearts of the Kraken trait:
>>The titanic monster's carapace cracks, revealing a pulsing, red-purple heart buried amid heaps of blubber and muscle. Fissures run across the beast's ancient shell, revealing three other mighty, ichor-slick organs. The sea terror thrashes, channeling pain into fury.
>>
Fighting Tromokratis as a mythic encounter is equivalent to taking on two CR 26 creatures in one encounter. Award a party 180,000 XP for defeating Tromokratis after it uses Hearts of the Kraken.
