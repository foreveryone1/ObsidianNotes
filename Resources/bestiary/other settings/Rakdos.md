>- **Sadistic Revelry.** Each creature within 60 feet of Rakdos that is his ally or is charmed by him must use its reaction to move up to half its speed toward the creature closest to it that it can see, provided it isn't already within 5 feet of that creature. It then must make one melee attack against that creature if it is able to do so.
>- **Scythe (Costs 2 Actions).** Rakdos uses Curtain-Call Scythe.
>- **Touch of Pain (Costs 3 Actions).** Rakdos makes a claw attack against one creature within 10 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the creature can't maintain concentration on a spell or any other effect that requires concentration. The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
## Rakdos
Rakdos, the demon for whom his cult is named, embodies hedonism. He is also the consummate entertainer, whose mere appearance is an act of grisly performance art. A monstrous figure standing thirty feet tall, spreading enormous wings, crowned with fire and swinging a flaming scythe, Rakdos demands the spotlight. His every entrance is a showstopper.
Sometimes after his grand entrance, Rakdos crouches to witness the performances of those who adore him. To them, his opinion is the only one that matters, but he is a demanding spectator. He has seen thousands of years of circus tricks and has no patience for performers who don't give their all. His flaming scythe has brought more than one tepid show to a sudden and spectacular close. Jaded as he is, Rakdos attends his cult's performances only rarely. He often retreats into his lair below the cult's guildhall for months or years at a time, but his followers know that he might emerge at any time to witness the latest spectacle.
