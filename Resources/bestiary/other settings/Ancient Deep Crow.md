## Ancient Deep Crow
So little is known of the deep crows that even less is known of their monstrous leviathan cousins, the ancient deep crows. Whether these gargantuan specimens are elder deep crows grown to great size or some higher form that holds lesser deep crows in thrall remains to be determined. Ideally by someone else. Seriously, stay away from these things.
#### Regional Effects
The region containing an ancient deep crow's lair is transformed by the creature's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:
- Supernatural shadow turns all bright light to dim light in underground regions within 6 miles of the lair.
- Intermittent, echoing caws can be heard coming from all directions within 6 miles of the lair.
- Subterranean beasts within 1 mile of the ancient deep crow's lair serve as the creature's eyes and ears, alerting it to the presence of intruders and making it all but impossible to surprise the ancient deep crow.
If the ancient deep crow dies, these effects fade immediately.
