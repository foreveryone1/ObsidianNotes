## Female Steeder
*Steeders resemble spiders as much as worgs resemble wolves. The creatures may appear similar, but steeders are more than mere vermin.*— Mordenkainen***Steeders.*** Giant hunting spiders, steeders prowl the depths of the Underdark. Most steeders are encountered in the company of duergar.
***Female Dominance.*** Female steeders grow larger and stronger than males, and the female often devours the male after breeding. In captivity, males are used as draft animals, while females serve as steeds in battle.
***Lone Predators.*** Steeders consider other steeders as enemies and attempt to tear apart perceived threats. Their duergar handlers must stable steeders separate from one another and place blinders on them when they're put to work to keep them from attacking each other.
***Low Cunning.*** Steeders are intelligent enough to learn simple hand signals and vocal commands, but even a domesticated steeder can turn against its handler. Training these beasts requires a rider to bond with the steeder, a process that begins shortly after the creature hatches. The rider stays with the steeder as it grows to full size, working throughout that time to channel the beast's predatory instincts.
***Deadly Hunters.*** Rather than spinning webs, steeders excrete a viscous substance from their legs. This goo allows them to creep along walls and ceilings and to grapple prey.
