## The Hungry
***The Hungry.*** Horrid beasts with grasping claws and yawning mouths, the Hungry do whatever is necessary to sate their appetites. These greedy devourers consume all life and energy they encounter, stuffing their maws with flesh and drinking in their victims' screams. When they finish, they lurch away while their bright eyes resume the search for something else to consume.
***Sorrowsworn.*** The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. The sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering that are inherent to the shadowy landscape, and they visit horror on those who stumble into their midst.
***Emotion Given Form.*** Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress. Some are manifestations of anger; others are loneliness given physical form. Their nature provides a clue both to understanding how they become more powerful and to overcoming them. Giving in to the negative emotions that the sorrowsworn represent causes these entities to grow deadlier. Fighting against these emotions can weaken them and drive them away.
