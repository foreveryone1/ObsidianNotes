If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the choker can't use this tentacle on another target. The choker has two tentacles. If this attack is a critical hit, the target also can't breathe or speak until the grapple ends.
## Choker
*Chokers are cowardly and dimwitted creatures, useless as guard beasts, and utterly awful as servants. Yet for wizards of shorter stature, securing one as a familiar does negate the need for a ladder.*— Mordenkainen***Choker.*** The choker is a subterranean predator far more dangerous than its small size and spindly, rubbery limbs would suggest.
Chokers have cartilage rather than a bony skeleton. This flexible internal structure enables them to easily slip into narrow fissures and niches in the walls of their cavern homes. They lurk in these spots, silent and unseen, waiting for prey to happen by.
***Sly Trappers.*** A choker's usual method for luring prey involves positioning the body of its latest catch just outside its hiding spot. Whenever it gets hungry, it tears off a few chunks of flesh to feed itself. In the meantime, the corpse serves to entice other curious humanoids—explorers, drow, duergar, or the choker's favorite prey, goblins—to come within reach.
When a target presents itself, the choker's starfish-shaped hands dart out of its hiding spot, wrap around the victim's throat, and pin the unfortunate creature against the cavern wall while choking out its life. Because its arms are so long, the choker can keep its body deep inside the crevice where it hides, beyond the reach of most normal weapons.
***Lone Hunters.*** Chokers tend to set their ambushes alone, rather than working in concert, but where one creature is found, others are likely to be nearby. They communicate through eerie, keening howls that travel long distances through rock but are difficult to identify or locate in a typical echo-filled cavern.
