## Merregon
*Merregons can't speak, and their telepathy is one-to-one. Their orderly ranks are easily confused if you slay their shouting masters.*â€” Mordenkainen***Merregon.*** The souls of fallen soldiers, mercenaries, and bodyguards who served evil without reservation often find everlasting servitude in the Nine Hells as merregons. These faceless foot soldiers are the hells' legionnaires, tasked with protecting the realm and its rulers against intruders.
***Masks of Uniformity.*** Merregons have no individuality, and hence no need for faces. Every merregon legionnaire has a metal mask bolted to its head. Markings on the mask indicate the only elements of the wearer's identity that matter: its commander and the layer of the Nine Hells it serves.
***Fearless Obedience.*** Because of their unshakable loyalty, merregons form the backbone of many devils' protective retinues. They shrink from no task, no matter how dangerous. Unless ordered to fall back, they retreat from no fight.
