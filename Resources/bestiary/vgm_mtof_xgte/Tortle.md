## Tortle
***Tortles.*** Tortles are omnivorous, turtle-like humanoids with shells that cover most of their bodies. Tortles have a saying: "We wear our homes on our backs." Consequently, tortles feel little need to stay put for long.
An adult tortle stands about 6 feet tall and weighs between 450 and 500 pounds. Males and females are nearly identical in size and appearance.
***Temporary Towns.*** A tortle settlement is primarily used as a kind of moot, where tortles can socialize with one another and trade with strangers. Tortles don't regard these settlements as places worth defending with their lives, and they abandon a settlement when it no longer serves their needs.
***A Life of Wandering.*** Most tortles like to see how other creatures live and discover new customs. The urge to procreate doesn't kick in until the end of a tortle's life, and a tortle can spend decades away from its native land without feeling homesick.
