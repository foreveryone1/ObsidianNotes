## Warlock of the Fiend
Warlocks of the fiend gain their powers through magical pacts forged with archfiends of the Lower Planes. These warlocks often keep imps or quasits as companions, and they tend toward extremes of behavior: consorting with fiend-worshiping cultists or dedicating their lives to destroying fiendish cults.
