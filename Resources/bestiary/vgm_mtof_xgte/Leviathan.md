>***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the leviathan fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.  
>
>***Partial Freeze.*** If the leviathan takes 50 cold damage or more during a single turn, the leviathan partially freezes; until the end of its next turn, its speeds are reduced to 20 feet, and it makes attack rolls with disadvantage.  
>
>***Siege Monster.*** The leviathan deals double damage to objects and structures (included in Tidal Wave).  
>
>***Water Form.*** The leviathan can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.  
>
## Actions
>***Multiattack.*** The leviathan makes two attacks: one with its slam and one with its tail.  
>
>***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (1d10 + 10) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (1d10) acid damage.  
>
>***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (1d12 + 10) bludgeoning damage plus 6 (1d12) acid damage.  
>
>***Tidal Wave (Recharge 6).*** While submerged, the leviathan magically creates a wall of water centered on itself. The wall is up 250 feet long, up to 250 feet high, and up to 50 feet thick. When the wall appears, all other creatures within its area must each make a DC 24 Strength saving throw. A creature takes 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage on failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
>At the start of each of the leviathan's turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any other creatures in it, moves 50 feet away from the leviathan. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving throw or take 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage. A creature takes this damage no more than once on a turn. At the end of each turn the wall moves, the wall's height is reduced by 50 feet, and the damage creatures take from the wall on subsequent rounds is reduced by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the effect ends.  
>A creature caught in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the creature must make a successful DC 24 Strength (Athletics) check to swim at all during that turn.  
>

>- **Move.** The leviathan moves up to its speed.
## Leviathan
***Leviathan.*** A towering wall of water that drags ships down to the ocean's depths and washes away coastal settlements—that phenomenon typifies the destruction a leviathan can unleash on the world. When called forth, a leviathan arises from a large body of water to form an immense serpent-shaped creature.
***Elder Elementals.*** On their native planes, elementals sweep across the weird and tempestuous landscape. Some possess greater power, gained by feeding on their lesser kin and adding the essence of creatures they have devoured to their own until they become something extraordinary. When summoned, these elder elementals manifest as beings of apocalyptic capability, entities whose mere existence promises destruction.
***Deadly When Summoned.*** The methods for summoning elder elementals remain hidden in forbidden tomes or inscribed on the walls of lost temples raised to honor the Elder Elemental Eye. Only casters of superlative skill have even the faintest chance of calling forth one of these monsters, and the spellcaster is often destroyed by the effort. Thus, only the most unhinged and nihilistic members of Elemental Evil cults attempt such a summoning, in the hope of hastening the world toward some cataclysmic end.
***Elemental Nature.*** An elder elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
