somewhat related to that is the mindfuck that widespread testing of rare diseases can actually be harmful

very counterintuitive, but if a test has a false positive rate of 95% but is very rare (and you're not in a vulnerable demographic) the stress may harm you more than being tested may benefit you

say a test for disease has a false positive rate of 5% (specificity of 95%) and 0 false negatives (which would be miraculous)
and it occurs across 1% of the population

that means for 1000 people tested
10 people have the disease, of which all of them tested positive correct (zero false negative rate)

that means there are 990 healthy people, of which 95% correctly test negative (940.5), and 5% test positive falsely (49.5)

or, in a table

| 1000 people   | healthy | sick |
| ------------- | ------- | ---- |
| positive test | 49.5    | 10   |
| negative test | 940.5   | 0    |

which means, astonishingly, that if you test positive there's only a ~17% chance (10/59.5) that you are actually sick
