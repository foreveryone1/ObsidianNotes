# Apollo
[spoken]
turning, revolving, undulating
in vast ellipses
never colliding
lost in a black inky void
caught in your gravity

this shell that protects me
prevents me from getting close

[scream]
abandon mission
set me free
cut the tether
I'm drawn to your gravity
leave a crater
watch me burn

[spoken]
I am a fleeting speck of light in the night sky
a mother and her child look upwards
the sole witnesses to a glorious immolation
in my burned out retina I can make out your face

# Isaac

Measure the world unknown in universal shapes
Yet you escape me
the fractals in your eyes reflect a vast infinity
the constellations emulate the freckles of your face
no patterns describe you, no shape can contain all your being
sacred geometry
sacred geometry

I can't calculate the way your absence makes me feel
you escape me
when my mind wanders spirals I think of the curve of your spine
the rise and fall, your every breath is god's own metronome
counting out the seconds I have to go without
sacred geometry
