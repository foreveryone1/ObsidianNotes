# fly the coop [working title]
locked by inertia  
wade through syrup  
burning time until my life gets clearer  

I'm lost adrift, I crave the new  
no inner hunger, starved of fuel  

I read the same things every night  
expecting change  
expecting change  
I read the same things every night  
expecting change  
expecting change  

no taste as sweet as helplessness  
a gilded cage that's left unlocked  
analysis paralysis  
I clipped my wings before the start  

locked by inertia  
drowned in syrup  
rotting figs
on branches shrivelled  

fly the coop  
come crashing down   
no other way  
this could have gone  



# Yossarian Lives [wip]

There are hills that you cannot conquer  
Fights pursued that aren't worth prolonging  
Buried dead deserve to be honoured  
Life well lived is the life of a coward  

An indian chieftain drowning on dry land  
a pair of twig legs standing upright no body attached  
a man of god with a broken heart  
The pointless deaths of a war already won  

Damn your eyes  
Curse your ambition  
We are the playthings  
Of adult children  


A whorehouse cleared out with no regard  
A mountainside village reduced to rubble  
Generation of crooks and thieves  
The walking corpses of forever war  

Damn your eyes  
Curse your ambition  
We are the playthings  
Of adult children  

Freezing cold on a summer bomb run  
Skeleton crew of second born sons  
Ask for more I have nothing to offer  
Ground me now, sky is blackened with schrapnel  

The bombs  
The bombs are falling  
Burn the cathedral  
Tear down your shelter  

The bombs  
The bombs are falling  
Burn the cathedral  
Tear down your shelter  

# Unfamiliar Ceilings [wip]
`muziek voor spoken word stuk, nog niet voor screams`

[spoken]  

A threefold hiss of air  
Your hot mess runs down my neck  
Staining all it touches  
A hot mess that renders all thoughts empty  

A witness in a body that ain't mine  
A body that ain't mine to operate  
Not speechless or motionless  
But words that aren't mine  
Actions autonomous  
Limp limbs to place where you please  
In alien machinery  
Hissing and beeping  

Torturously fragile  
A steel anchor weighs me down  
Radiating pulses, alienate mind from body  
Electric signals in a body all too cooperative  
A body pitifully yielding to your hands

A witness in a body that ain't mine  
A body that ain't mine to operate  
Not speechless or motionless  
But words that aren't mine  
Actions autonomous  
Limp limbs to place where you please  
In alien machinery  
Hissing and beeping  

Jagged needles digging in   
Flesh hooks carving art of me  
The rot is oozing flowing free  
Purge the poison  
Tear the flesh  
Your fingertips are painted red  
Purge the poison  
Tear the flesh  
Your fingertips are painted red  
Bright life flows out  


~~[screams]~~

~~Stars ignite behind my eyes~~   
~~Cauterise the wound you left~~  
~~Curse the poison of the flesh~~  
~~Bright life flows out~~ 

~~Blue lights flashing~~  
~~Tesselated plastic squares~~  
~~An unfamiliar ceiling~~  
~~Groping blindly are you there~~  
~~An unfamiliar ceiling~~  
~~The air is still with life preserved~~  
~~An unfamiliar ceiling~~  
~~Smother me to dull the screams~~  
~~An unfamiliar ceiling~~  


~~If you can speak, then I'm dumb~~  
~~Marching to the dull hum~~  
~~of bright fluorescent lights~~  

~~Purge the poison~~  
~~Tear the flesh~~  
~~Your fingertips are painted red~~  
~~Bright life flows out~~  

~~Purge the poison~~  
~~Tear the flesh~~  
~~Your fingertips are painted red~~  
~~Bright life flows out~~  

~~Purge the poison~~  
~~Tear the flesh~~  
~~Your fingertips are painted red~~  
~~Bright life flows out~~  

# Ik maak u kapot (ma dan in't engels)
Bare knuckle  
Clenched fist  
Beat your chest you mean it  
  
Bare knuckle  
Clenched fist  
Beat your chest you mean it  
  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
  
society's bruises  
the dumb and the useless  
  
hand of the hungry  
take what you earn  
  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
  
inner jihad  
mouth full of blood  

we bite the hand that did not feed  
forsake our masters make em bleed

Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  

born from the mud    
aim for the eyes  
we are the flood  
comrades alive  
  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence

`werk nodig om instrumental spoken word deel met screams te linken`

[spoken]  
a young girl, in a bright pink dress  
clutches her father's hand  
large and calloused, a 5-digit promise of safety  
years later, you'll be sitting on the side of a grassy hill  
punch-drunk and ready to bare your heart  
she'll reminisce about looking up at the sky  
while coming home from watching some movie
about cartoon dog superheroes  
and seeing a fleeting speck of light in the night sky  
the sole witness to a celestial immolation  
  
the atmosphere has ripped away my shell  
harsh winds have torn me to shreds  
In my burned out retina I can just make out your face  

[scream]  
abandon mission  
set me free  
cut the tether  
I'm drawn to your gravity  
leave no crater  
watch me burn  
  
[spoken]  
turning, revolving, undulating  
in vast ellipses  
never colliding  
lost in a black inky void  
caught in your gravity  
  
this shell that sustained me  
kept me from all that I want  

[scream]  
abandon mission  
I'm untethered, floating free  
tumble down to earth  
leave no crater  
watch me burn 
  
[spoken]  
she leans her head against your chest  
her perfumed hair tickles your nose  
she tilts her head back to meet your eyes  
this time you'll make it last

Measure the world unknown in universal shapes  
Yet you escape me  
the fractals in your eyes reflect a vast infinity  
the constellations emulate the freckles of your face  
no patterns describe you, no shape can contain all your being  
sacred geometry  
sacred geometry  

I can't calculate the way your absence makes me feel  
you escape me  
when my mind wanders spirals I think of the curve of your spine  
the rise and fall, your every breath is god's own metronome  
counting out the seconds I have to go without  
sacred geometry
