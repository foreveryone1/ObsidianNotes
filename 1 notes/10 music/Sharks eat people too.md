# Jakarta Syndrome
Naar `[[ ]] Heat` van [Nick Land](http://www.ccru.net/swarm1/1_melt.htm)  

the tangle of your sweaty limbs under thin sheets  
a stale glass of water  
midnight walks  
cling to the skin like a parasite  

heat breeds heat  
heat breeds heat  

heat ebbs and flows  
we chase heat like songbirds  
flitting from branch to branch [invallen na 4 tellen]  
staring down the hunter's barrel  

heat breeds heat  

creating heat to move heat  
the sea is boiling and we stare at the spectacle  
we drown out the stars  
and suffocate a dead sun  

heat breeds heat  

the heat of crowds  
thrumming with sound  
feed sugar to the ants  
march to entropic circles  

thin headed dizziness  
delirious anger  
manic preaching on the streets  
in the shadow of babel towers  
heat radiates from steel and glass  
praying for a reckoning  

heat breeds heat  
heat breeds heat  
heat breeds heat  

[spoken]
we're all greedy flecks of ash  
consuming heat to create heat  
born with starving furnaces
this fever keeps on rising
I think I understand Meursault  

heat breeds heat  
heat breeds heat  
heat breeds heat  
heat breeds heat  
# Shaheed
Naar het verhaal van [Aitzaz Hasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitzaz_Hasan)  
Ontbreekt muziek

I am a faithful of god's chosen few  
this is the harvest of a hundred fruit  
we seek refuge  
in hollow hills  
from foreign fire  
begin anew  

Walk bare-foot on mountain roads  
My only words are copper shards  
through untuned antenna  
radio hisses  
reveal the word of god  

carve a thousand verses  
in the sinew of my heart  
In shadowed rooms  
I raised my hand  
death's white shroud hangs round my neck   

blackened pages   
drifting on the wind  
will be the headstone  
for a thousand lights  

shovel dirt so there's no turning back  
my heart was racing when I strapped up the vest  
past metal doors, my steps resound  
reverberating voices tell me where to go  

you caught me, in arms unmoving  
what were you thinking when your skin dissolved  

Is there a witness in the sky above?  
will I be waking from a martyr's sleep?  

beside a gravel road  
they lie forgotten  
nobody left to clean their graves  
the radio keeps on hissing
but his word is lost to me  

# vivisection
Put on the gloves  
to keep up the pretence  
no need for anaesthesia, it's routine habit  
I need to catalogue every piece  

peel back the sternum  
take in the view  
your copper flows  
in a stark white cage  

I want to make you hurt  
I want to hold your heart  
and when I squeeze my hand I want to see it beat  
Feel every PULSE  
of your feeble body  
Make it mine  
Make it mine   
Make it mine   

I thought you trusted me  
Show me your open wounds  
What keeps you up at night  
Let me pick the scabs  

Two hundred thirteen bones  
twenty eight teeth  
catalogue every piece  
I'll keep you by my side, you'll never feel alone

I savour your every taste  
When I put my mouth to your jaw  
and inhale  
a shard of bone clings to my throat  

I want to feel your pain  
I want to hold your heart  
and when I squeeze my hand I want to see it beat  
Feel every PULSE  
of your feeble body  
Make it mine  
Make it mine   
Make it mine  
Make you mine  

# fly the coop [wip]
do you remember the forest beside our houses?  
we'd bike like fools over logs and ditches  
and in the light filtered by the canopy  
time didn't exist until our mothers called us home

the first time I ever swore
you picked me up by the collar  
you asked me  
who taught me how to swear?  
you promised me  
if you ever caught me again  
wallahi, you'd kick my ass  

locked by inertia  
wade through syrup  
burning time until my life gets clearer  

I'm lost adrift, I crave the new  
no inner hunger, starved of fuel  

I read the same things every night  
expecting change  
expecting    
I read the same things every night  
expecting change  
expecting   
I read the same things every night  
expecting change  
expecting   
I read the same things every night  
expecting change  
expecting    

I cried the first day after moving  
these buzzing social circles felt so impenetrable  
~~we were the only brown kids, so of course we got along~~    
~~our english teacher called you Ishmael, like you were from the bible~~  

we were swinging sticks like swords  
and I split your lip  
I didn't call for help or apologise  
I just stared and stared  
at the bloody pink spit trailing from your mouth  

locked by inertia  
drowned in syrup  
rotting figs
on branches shrivelled  

no taste as sweet as helplessness  
a gilded cage that's left unlocked  
analysis paralysis  
I clipped my wings before the start  

fly the coop  
come crashing down   
no other way  
this could have gone  

I read the same things every night  
expecting change  
expecting    
I read the same things every night  
expecting change  
expecting   
I read the same things every night  
expecting change  
expecting   
I read the same things every night  
expecting change  
expecting   
# Yossarian Lives

There are hills that you cannot conquer  
Fights pursued that aren't worth prolonging  
Buried dead deserve to be honoured  
Life well lived is the life of a coward  

An indian chieftain drowning on dry land  
a pair of twig legs standing upright no body attached  
a man of god with a broken heart  
The pointless deaths of a war already won  

Damn your eyes  
Curse your ambition  
We are the playthings  
Of adult children  

A whorehouse cleared out with no regard  
A mountainside village reduced to rubble  
Generation of crooks and thieves  
The walking corpses of forever war  

Damn your eyes  
Curse your ambition  
We are the playthings  
Of adult children  

Freezing cold on a summer bomb run  
Skeleton crew of second born sons  
Ask for more I have nothing to offer  
Ground me now, sky is blackened with schrapnel  

The bombs  
The bombs are falling  
Burn your cathedral  
Tear down your shelter  

Burn your cathedral  
Tear down your shelter  
Burn your cathedral  
Tear down your shelter  
Burn your cathedral  
Tear down your shelter 


# Unfamiliar Ceilings

A threefold hiss of air  
Your hot mess runs down my neck  
Staining all it touches  
A hot mess that renders all thoughts empty  

A witness in a body that ain't mine  
A body that ain't mine to operate  
Not speechless or motionless  
But words that aren't mine  
Actions autonomous  
Limp limbs to place where you please  
In alien machinery  
Hissing and beeping  

Torturously fragile  
A steel anchor weighs me down  
Radiating pulses, alienate mind from body  
Electric signals in a body all too cooperative  
A body pitifully yielding to your hands

A witness in a body that ain't mine  
A body that ain't mine to operate  
Not speechless or motionless  
But words that aren't mine  
Actions autonomous  
Limp limbs to place where you please  
In alien machinery  
Hissing and beeping  

Tessellated plastic squares  
An unfamiliar ceiling  
Groping blindly  
Are you there  
Under an unfamiliar ceiling?  

Jagged needles digging in   
Flesh hooks carving art of me  
The rot is oozing flowing free  
Purge the poison  
Tear the flesh  
Your fingertips are painted red  
Purge the poison  
Tear the flesh  
Your fingertips are painted red  
Bright life flows out  


~~[screams]~~

~~Stars ignite behind my eyes~~   
~~Cauterise the wound you left~~  
~~Curse the poison of the flesh~~  
~~Bright life flows out~~ 

~~Blue lights flashing~~  
~~Tesselated plastic squares~~  
~~An unfamiliar ceiling~~  
~~Groping blindly are you there~~  
~~An unfamiliar ceiling~~  
~~The air is still with life preserved~~  
~~An unfamiliar ceiling~~  
~~Smother me to dull the screams~~  
~~An unfamiliar ceiling~~  


~~If you can speak, then I'm dumb~~  
~~Marching to the dull hum~~  
~~of bright fluorescent lights~~  

~~Purge the poison~~  
~~Tear the flesh~~  
~~Your fingertips are painted red~~  
~~Bright life flows out~~  

~~Purge the poison~~  
~~Tear the flesh~~  
~~Your fingertips are painted red~~  
~~Bright life flows out~~  

~~Purge the poison~~  
~~Tear the flesh~~  
~~Your fingertips are painted red~~  
~~Bright life flows out~~

Reach Heaven Through Violence

Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
  
inner jihad  
mouth full of blood  

we bite the hand that did not feed  
forsake our masters make em bleed

Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  

born from the mud    
aim for the eyes  
we are the flood  
comrades alive

Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
  
# Apollo

[spoken]  
a young girl, in a bright pink dress  
clutches her father's hand  
large and calloused, a 5-digit promise of safety  
years later, you'll be sitting on the side of a grassy hill  
punch-drunk and ready to bare your heart  
she'll reminisce about looking up at the sky  
while coming home from watching some movie
about cartoon dog superheroes  
and seeing a fleeting speck of light in the night sky  
the sole witness to a celestial immolation  
  
the atmosphere has ripped away my shell  
harsh winds have torn me to shreds  
In my burned out retina I can just make out your face  

[scream]  
abandon mission  
set me free  
cut the tether  
I'm drawn to your gravity  
leave no crater  
watch me burn  
  
[spoken]  
turning, revolving, undulating  
in vast ellipses  
never colliding  
lost in a black inky void  
caught in your gravity  
  
this shell that sustained me  
kept me from all that I want  

[scream]  
abandon mission  
I'm untethered, floating free  
tumble down to earth  
leave no crater  
watch me burn 
  
[spoken]  
she leans her head against your chest  
her perfumed hair tickles your nose  
she tilts her head back to meet your eyes  
this time you'll make it last  
  
# Isaac
  
Measure the world unknown in universal shapes  
Yet you escape me  
the fractals in your eyes reflect a vast infinity  
the constellations emulate the freckles of your face  
no patterns describe you, no shape can contain all your being  
sacred geometry  
sacred geometry  

I can't calculate the way your absence makes me feel  
you escape me  
when my mind wanders spirals I think of the curve of your spine  
the rise and fall, your every breath is god's own metronome  
counting out the seconds I have to go without  
sacred geometry
