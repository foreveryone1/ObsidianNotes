# voorbereiding eerste optreden

Plan: elke resterende repdag met minieme bazel en hervattingen de setlist doorspelen
post-pauze sleutelen

Extra optie: komende maand een zaterdag of twee (niet te veel - verzadiging) 40 minuten samenkomen om de setlist door te spelen (en dan gezellig iets samen eten ðŸ¥º)?

# shark chant
I am a shark  
I swim in the water  

I am the drowned  
I float in the water

I am the blood  
you are a feeding frenzy

# Immurement

I'll build this tomb  
brick by brick  
keep the filth  
out my sinner's heart  

send me to starve
in a barren desert  
to deny my hunger  
deny my hunger  

trade solitude for a kingdom  
these windows don't let in much light  
I succeed to make them suffer  
what I give is never enough for you  

When you tear down my walls
When you tear down my walls
don't you **see**  
**I'm** terrified  

It's never enough  
It's never enough  
Wash my hands raw  
But the sin remains  

throw me in your current deep  
below the surface cutting water from water  
vortex sweeps me off my feet
isaac smiled when you took him to slaughter

the colour seeps  
from a bloated corpse  
bleached bones surface  
at low tide  

RELIVE. REGRET. REVERSE. DESTROY.  




# Jakarta Syndrome
Naar `[[ ]] Heat` van [Nick Land](http://www.ccru.net/swarm1/1_melt.htm)  

the tangle of your sweaty limbs under thin sheets  
a stale glass of water  
midnight walks  
cling to the skin like a parasite  

heat breeds heat  
heat breeds heat  

heat ebbs and flows  
we chase heat like songbirds  
flitting from branch to branch [invallen na 4 tellen]  
staring down the hunter's barrel  

heat breeds heat  

creating heat to move heat  
the sea is boiling and we stare at the spectacle  
we drown out the stars  
and suffocate a dead sun  

heat breeds heat  

the heat of crowds  
thrumming with sound  
feed sugar to the ants  
march to entropic circles  

thin headed dizziness  
delirious anger  
manic preaching on the streets  
in the shadow of babel towers  
heat radiates from steel and glass  
praying for a reckoning  

heat breeds heat  
heat breeds heat  
heat breeds heat  

[spoken]
we're all greedy flecks of ash  
consuming heat to create heat  
born with starving furnaces
this fever keeps on rising
I think I understand Meursault  

heat breeds heat  
heat breeds heat  
heat breeds heat  
heat breeds heat  
# Shaheed
Naar het verhaal van [Aitzaz Hasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aitzaz_Hasan)  
Ontbreekt muziek

I am a faithful of god's chosen few  
this is the harvest of a hundred fruit  
in hollow hills  
we seek refuge  
from foreign fire  
begin anew  

Walk bare-foot on mountain roads  
My only words are copper shards  
through untuned antenna  
radio hisses  
reveal the word of god  

carve a thousand verses  
in the sinew of my heart  
In shadowed rooms  
I raised my hand  
death's white shroud hangs round my neck   

blackened pages   
drifting on the wind  
will be the headstone  
for a thousand lights  

~~shovel dirt so there's no turning back~~  
~~reverberating voices tell me where to go~~  

past metal doors, my steps resound   
my heart was racing when I strapped up the vest  
you caught me, in arms unmoving  
what were you thinking when your skin dissolved  

Is there a witness in the sky above?  
will I awaken from a martyr's sleep?  

beside a gravel road  
I lie forgotten  
nobody left to clean my grave  
the radio keeps on hissing
but his word is lost to me  
his word is lost to me  
his word is lost to me  

# vivisection
Put on the gloves  
to keep up the pretence  
no need for anaesthesia, it's routine habit  
I need to catalogue every piece  

peel back the sternum  
take in the view  
your copper flows  
in a stark white cage  

I want to make you hurt  
I want to hold your heart  
and when I squeeze my hand I want to see it beat  
Feel every PULSE  
of your feeble body  
Make it mine  
Make it mine   
Make it mine   

I thought you trusted me  
Show me your open wounds  
What keeps you up at night  
Let me pick the scabs  

Two hundred thirteen bones  
twenty eight teeth  
catalogue every piece  
I'll keep you by my side, you'll never feel alone

I savour your every taste  
When I put my mouth to your jaw  
and inhale  
a shard of bone clings to my throat  

I want to feel your pain  
I want to hold your heart  
and when I squeeze my hand I want to see it beat  
Feel every PULSE  
of your feeble body  
Make it mine  
Make it mine   
Make it mine  
Make you mine  

# fly the coop
do you remember the forest next door?  
we'd bike like fools over logs and ditches  
and in the light filtered by the canopy  
time didn't exist until our mothers called us home

crystallised time slips through my fingers
our english teacher called you Ishmael
we were swinging sticks like swords  
and I split your lip  
I didn't call for help or apologise  
I just stared and stared  
at the bright pink spit trailing from your mouth  

locked by inertia  
wade through syrup  
burning time until my life gets clearer  

~~no taste as sweet as helplessness~~  
~~a gilded cage that's left unlocked~~  
choke my heart on bitter spite  
analysis paralysis  
I clipped my wings before the start 

I'm lost adrift, I crave the new  
no inner hunger, starved of fuel  

I read the same things every night  
expecting change  
I read the same things every night  
expecting change (maartenÂ£)  

when did you look away?  
when did our faces change  
when did our faces change  
when did our faces change  
when did our faces change  
I thought that we would stay the same

~~locked by inertia~~  
~~drowned in syrup~~  
~~rotting figs~~
~~on branches shrivelled~~

~~fly the coop~~  
~~come crashing down~~   
~~no other way~~  
~~this could have gone~~  

~~the first time I ever swore~~
~~you picked me up by the collar~~  
~~you asked m~~~~e~~  
~~who taught me how to swear?~~  
~~you promised me~~  
~~if you ever caught me again~~  
~~wallahi, you'd kick my ass~~  

# Yossarian Lives

there are hills that you cannot conquer  
fights pursued that aren't worth prolonging  
buried dead deserve to be honoured  
life well lived is the life of a coward  

an indian chieftain drowning on dry land  
a pair of twig legs standing upright no body attached  
a man of god with a broken heart  
The pointless deaths of a war already won  

damn your eyes  
curse your ambition  
we are the playthings  
of adult children  

a whorehouse cleared out with no regard  
a mountainside village reduced to rubble  
generation of crooks and thieves  
the walking corpses of forever war  

damn your eyes  
curse your ambition  
we are the playthings  
of adult children  

freezing cold on a summer bomb run  
skeleton crew of second born sons  
ask for more I have nothing to offer  
ground me now, sky is blackened with schrapnel  

the bombs  
the bombs are falling  
burn your cathedral  
tear down your shelter  

Burn your cathedral  
Tear down your shelter  
Burn your cathedral  
Tear down your shelter  
Burn your cathedral  
Tear down your shelter 

# Unfamiliar Ceilings

A threefold hiss of air  
Your hot mess runs down my neck  
Staining all it touches  
A hot mess that renders all thoughts empty  

A witness in a body that ain't mine  
A body that ain't mine to operate  
Not speechless or motionless  
But words that aren't mine  

Torturously fragile  
A steel anchor weighs me down  
Radiating pulses, alienate mind from body  
Electric signals in a body all too cooperative  

Actions autonomous  
Limp limbs to place where you please  
In alien machinery  
Hissing and beeping  

Stars ignite behind my eyes   
Cauterise the wound you left  
Curse the poison of the flesh  
Bright life flows out 

If you can speak  
then I'm dumb    
Marching to the dull hum  
of bright fluorescent lights  

Tessellated plastic squares  
An unfamiliar ceiling  
Smother me to dull the screams  
An unfamiliar ceiling  

~~A body pitifully yielding to your hands~~  

~~Jagged needles digging in~~  
~~Flesh hooks carving art of me~~  
~~The rot is oozing flowing free~~  

~~Blue lights flashing~~  
~~Tesselated plastic squares~~  
~~An unfamiliar ceiling~~  
~~Groping blindly are you there~~  
~~An unfamiliar ceiling~~  
~~The air is still with life preserved~~  
~~An unfamiliar ceiling~~  
~~Smother me to dull the screams~~  
~~An unfamiliar ceiling~~  

~~Purge the poison~~  
~~Tear the flesh~~  
~~Your fingertips are painted red~~  
~~Bright life flows out~~

Bare knuckle  
Clenched fist  
Beat your chest you mean it

Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
  
Society's bruises  
The dumb and the useless  
  
Hand of the hungry  
Take what you earn  
  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  

Born from the mud    
Aim for the eyes  
We are the flood  
Comrades alive  

Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
  
Inner jihad  
Mouth full of blood  

We bite the hand that did not feed  
Forsake our masters make em bleed
  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence

[spoken]  
a young girl, in a bright pink dress  
clutches her father's hand  
large and calloused, a 5-digit promise of safety  
years later, you'll be sitting on the side of a grassy hill  
punch-drunk and ready to bare your heart  
she'll reminisce about looking up at the sky  
while coming home from watching some movie
about cartoon dog superheroes  
and seeing a fleeting speck of light  
the sole witness to a celestial immolation  
  
the atmosphere has ripped away my shell  
harsh winds have torn me to shreds  
In my burned out retina I can just make out your face  

[scream]  
abandon mission  
set me free  
cut the tether  
I'm drawn to your gravity  
leave no crater  
watch me burn  
  
[spoken]  
turning, revolving, undulating  
in vast ellipses  
never colliding  
lost in a black inky void  
caught in your gravity  
  
this shell that sustained me  
kept me from all that I want  

[scream]  
abandon mission  
I'm untethered, floating free  
tumble down to earth  
leave no crater  
watch me burn 
  
[spoken]  
she leans her head against your chest  
her perfumed hair tickles your nose  
she tilts her head back to meet your eyes  
this time you'll make it last

Measure the world unknown in universal shapes  
Yet you escape me  
the fractals in your eyes reflect a vast infinity  
the constellations emulate the freckles of your face  
no patterns describe you
no shape can contain all your being  
sacred geometry  
sacred geometry  

you are an equation with no answer  
you are the ink I spilled  
you are the pages shredded  
you are the chalk that clings  
on my clothes and on my fingers  
you are you are you are

I can't calculate the way your absence makes me feel  
you escape me  
when my mind wanders spirals
I think of the curve of your spine  
the rise and fall, your every breath is god's own metronome  
counting out the seconds I have to go without
