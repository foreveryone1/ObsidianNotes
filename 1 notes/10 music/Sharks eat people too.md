# Unfamiliar Ceilings [wip]
> notes: dissociation, sterility, passenger in own body

Lightning strikes thrice  
A hiss of air  
Your hot mess runs down my neck  

Stars ignite behind my eyes  
Bright life flows out  

When you speak, then I'm dumb  
Marching to the dull hum  
of bright fluorescent lights  

Another unfamiliar ceiling    

Purge the poison  
Tear the flesh  
Your fingertips stained red  

# Ik maak u kapot (ma dan in't engels)
Bare knuckle  
Clenched fist  
Beat your chest you mean it  
  
Bare knuckle  
Clenched fist  
Beat your chest you mean it  
  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
  
society's bruises  
the dumb and the useless  
  
hand of the hungry  
take what you earn  
  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
  
inner jihad  
mouth full of blood  

we bite the hand that did not feed  
forsake our masters make em bleed

Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  

born from the mud    
aim for the eyes  
we are the flood  
comrades alive  
  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
Reach Heaven Through Violence  
  
# Apollo [wip]

[spoken]  
a young girl, in a bright pink dress  
clutches her father's hand  
large and calloused, a 5-digit promise of safety  
years later, you'll be sitting on the side of a grassy hill  
punch-drunk and ready to bare your heart  
she'll reminisce about looking up at the sky  
while coming home from watching some movie
about cartoon dog superheroes  
and seeing a fleeting speck of light in the night sky  
the sole witness to a celestial immolation  
  
the atmosphere has ripped away my shell  
harsh winds have torn me to shreds  
In my burned out retina I can just make out your face  

[scream]  
abandon mission  
set me free  
cut the tether  
I'm drawn to your gravity  
leave no crater  
watch me burn  
  
[spoken]  
turning, revolving, undulating  
in vast ellipses  
never colliding  
lost in a black inky void  
caught in your gravity  
  
this shell that sustained me  
kept me from all that I want  
  

[scream]  
abandon mission  
I'm untethered, floating free  
tumble down to earth  
leave no crater  
watch me burn 
  
[spoken]  
she leans her head against your chest  
her perfumed hair tickles your nose  
she tilts her head back to meet your eyes  
this time you'll make it last  
  
# Isaac
  
Measure the world unknown in universal shapes  
Yet you escape me  
the fractals in your eyes reflect a vast infinity  
the constellations emulate the freckles of your face  
no patterns describe you, no shape can contain all your being  
sacred geometry  
sacred geometry  

I can't calculate the way your absence makes me feel  
you escape me  
when my mind wanders spirals I think of the curve of your spine  
the rise and fall, your every breath is god's own metronome  
counting out the seconds I have to go without  
sacred geometry
