# Apollo [wip]
[spoken]  
turning, revolving, undulating  
in vast ellipses  
never colliding  
lost in a black inky void  
caught in your gravity  
  
this shell that sustains me  
keeps me from all that I want  
  
[scream]  
abandon mission  
set me free  
cut the tether  
I'm drawn to your gravity  
leave no crater  
watch me burn  
  
[spoken]  
a young girl, in a bright pink dress  
clutches her father's hand  
large and calloused, a 5-digit promise of safety  
years later, you'll be sitting on the side of a grassy hill  
punch-drunk and ready to bare your heart  
she'll reminisce about looking up at the sky  
after coming home from watching some movie about cartoon dog superheroes  
and seeing a fleeting speck of light in the night sky  
the sole witness to a celestial immolation  
  
the atmosphere has ripped away my shell  
harsh winds have torn me to shreds  
In my burned out retina I can just make out your face  

[scream]  
abandon mission  
set me free  
I'm untethered  
tumble down to earth  
leave no crater  
watch me burn 
  
[spoken]  
she leans her head against your chest  
her perfumed hair tickles your nose  
this time you'll make it last

Measure the world unknown in universal shapes  
Yet you escape me  
the fractals in your eyes reflect a vast infinity  
the constellations emulate the freckles of your face  
no patterns describe you, no shape can contain all your being  
sacred geometry  
sacred geometry  

I can't calculate the way your absence makes me feel  
you escape me  
when my mind wanders spirals I think of the curve of your spine  
the rise and fall, your every breath is god's own metronome  
counting out the seconds I have to go without  
sacred geometry
