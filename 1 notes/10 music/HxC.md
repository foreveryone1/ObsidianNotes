# Sound and the fury
bright shapes pass me by
I catch her in my arms
a whiff of pollen
she smells like trees

her skirt is muddy
her smile's faded
why have we been changed
I can hear my cries

# Astronaut

your face haunts me
caught in your gravity
heavenly bodies
turning revolving undulating
never colliding
cut the tether
I'm set adrift
last gasping breaths

# sacred geometry

Measure the world I know in formulas and shapes
Yet you escape me
the fractals in your eyes reflect a vast infinity
the constellations emulate the freckles of your face
no patterns describe you, no shape can contain all your being
sacred geometry
sacred geometry

I can't calculate the way your absence makes me feel
you escape me
when my mind wanders spirals I think of the curve of your spine
the rise and the fall **of** yr every breath is god's own metronome
counting out the seconds I have to go without
sacred geometry
