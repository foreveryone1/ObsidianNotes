# Sound and the fury
bright shapes pass me by
I catch her in my arms
a whiff of pollen
she smells like trees

her skirt is muddy
her smile's faded
why have we been changed
I can hear my cries

# Astronaut

your face haunts me
caught in your gravity
heavenly bodies
turning revolving undulating
never colliding
cut the tether
I'm set adrift
last gasping breaths

# sacred geometry

sacred geometry
the fractals in your eyes reflect a vast infinity
when my mind wanders spirals I think of the curve of your spine
the freckles on your face emulate the constellations

the rise and fall of your chest is god's own metronome
sacred geometry
