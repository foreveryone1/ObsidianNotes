# Sound and the fury
bright shapes pass me by
I catch her in my arms
a whiff of pollen
she smells like trees

her skirt is muddy
her smile's faded
why have we been changed
I can hear my cries

# Astronaut

your face haunts me
caught in your gravity
heavenly bodies
turning revolving undulating
never colliding
cut the tether
I'm set adrift
last gasping breaths

# sacred geometry


the fractals in your eyes reflect a vast infinity
the constellations emulate all the freckles of your face
no patterns describe you, no shape can contain all your being
sacred geometry
sacred geometry

when my mind wanders spirals I think of the curve of your spine
the rise and the fall of your chest is god's own metronome
sacred geometry
