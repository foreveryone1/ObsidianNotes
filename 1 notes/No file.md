To be able to find the Rat Talisman, the party needs to first try and search for clues.

The party can do an Investigation or Persuasion Check to see if they find information through the city.

| DC 11  |   You realize there's plenty of rats around the city, and they almost seem organized in a way.            |    You lie your way through the crowds, acting as if you're some kind of investigator with a reputation, and get a person to admit that they've heard rumors about people getting swarmed by rats and getting stuff stolen from them.       |        
| DC 13  |    Taking a look at some rats, you realize they seem to be... communicating to eachother? with speech and signs,.           |     You swindle a person into letting you know about the existence of a new gang called the Nezumi Tribe      | 
| DC 15  |   Observing the crowds, you see some people doing illicit deals in alleys and some evven in plain sight,  following them would lead you somewhere where you can find more information                |    You find yourself lying to a small time delinquent, and he admits knowledge of a the black market       |  
| DC 18  |   You spot various rats stealing trinkets through the streets and entering sewers and openings and running on the side of the bridge towards the underside of it.       |    You convince someone into letting you know of a deal going down regarding some 'merchandise stolen by rats' in the undercity black market       |  
| DC 20  |  You find a specific marking through the street that seems to almost take you through a path underneath the main three bridges       |    You lie about being an influential criminal or person, gaining an invitation towards the black market of the city.       |
