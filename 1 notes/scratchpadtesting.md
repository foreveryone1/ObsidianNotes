## Heading one
So this is some text that I want to display in two columns

with line breaks and interruptions and **bolding** and *italics*

I suppose you could do this, but then of course your document will have a 'part made for reading', and a part with the actual content that you edit.

## Heading two
some more text that I'm just going to plop down and let it write on and on and on and on and on and on

#text-space

HP is dead. Long live the checkbox.
When you get hit, choose what checkbox to check and apply the consequence.
- [ ] You are dead. You are allowed a dramatic action to influence the 'scene'.
- [ ] Your shield breaks.
- [ ] Your armor caught the blow this time.
- [ ] You got lucky and dodged the blow.
- [ ] You suffer a long-term wound determined by the DM.
- [ ] You suffer a consequence appropriate to the monster that hit you.

Different classes and archetypes add different checkboxes which players can choose.
