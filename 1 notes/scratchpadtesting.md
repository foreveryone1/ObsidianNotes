## Heading one
So this is some text that I want to display in two columns

with line breaks and interruptions and **bolding** and *italics*

I suppose you could do this, but then of course your document will have a 'part made for reading', and a part with the actual content that you edit.

## Heading two
some more text that I'm just going to plop down and let it write on and on and on and on and on and on

#text-space
