## Cyrus on loyalty to former friends
> He said that Cyrus opened the inquiry with these words: "I have invited you hither, my friends, that I may take advice with you, and carry out whatever, in the sight of God and man, it is right for me to do, as concerning the man before you, Orontas. The prisoner was, in the first instance, given to me by my father, to be my faithful subject. In the next place, acting, to use his own words, under the orders of my brother, and having hold of the acropolis of Sardis, he went to war with me.
> I met war with war, and forced him to think it more prudent to desist from war with me: whereupon we shook hands, exchanging solemn pledges. After that," and at this point Cyrus turned to Orontas, and addressed him personallyâ€”"after that, did I do you any wrong?"
> Answer, "Never."
> Again another question: "Then later on, having received, as you admit, no injury from me, did you revolt to the Mysians and injure my territory, as far as in you lay?"
> "I did," was the reply.
> "Then, once more having discovered the limits of your power, did you flee to the altar of Artemis, crying out that you repented? and did you thus work upon my feelings, that we a second time shook hands and made interchange of solemn pledges? Are these things so?"
> Orontas again assented. "Then what injury have you received from me," Cyrus asked, "that now for the third time, you have been detected in a treasonous plot against me?"
> "I must needs do so," he answered. Then Cyrus put one more question: "But the day may come, may it not, when you will once again be hostile to my brother, and a faithful friend to myself?"
> The other answered: "Even if I were, you could never be brought to believe it, Cyrus."
> (...)
> After they had conducted him to the tent of Artapates, the trustiest of Cyrus's wand-bearers, none set eyes upon him ever again, alive or dead. No one, of his own knowledge, could declare the manner of his death; though some conjectured one thing and some another. No tomb to mark his resting-place, either then or since, was ever seen.

Only after his trust was betrayed several times did Cyrus decide to punish Orontas, as he recognised that political reality sometimes leads to allies turning their backs to each other.

There is no justification for the threefold betrayal of his trust however.

## Cyrus's qualities as a ruler
> Now the advice and admonition of all who came into conversation with him was, not to enter the battle himself, but to post himself in rear of themselves
