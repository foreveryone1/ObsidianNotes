In an oft-quoted commencement speech, David Foster Wallace analogises the invisible self-evidence of water surrounding fish to the realities so obvious we do not actively perceive or discuss them.

This analogy has been leveraged in defence of capitalist liberal democracy and its values in the face of critiques made against it from within its luxuries. Besides the arguments and counterarguments on the Western material abundance in the face of inequality and resource extraction in the Global South, individualism has been the target of countless critiques, yet it enjoys an unassailable position.

One can point out the erosion of reproductive and trans rights as curtailing of individual liberties, but these attacks operate within the liberal individualist framework - the right for an individual to deny service based on his or her beliefs, the right of an unborn individual to live; it is a debate on which liberties take primacy, not a dispute about the existence of said liberties. The omnipresence of debates in media and politics on the rights of the individual, from vaccines, to fifteen minute city furore, to gun control, reflect the hold of individualism on contemporary thought.

However, we do not take to the water surrounding us as well as the fish in the analogy. A growing unease with the excesses of individualism can be seen among the young. Social media discourse is inundated with alternatives to individualistic liberal life, from posts advocating "trad life" or "anti-work" sentiments, to mockeries of common individualistic archetypes such as grindset influencers and capitalistic girl bosses.

Yet these alternatives to capitalist thinking remain highly individualistic solutions. A retreat into rural Arcady or a withdrawal from capitalistic striving are both solutions on an individual scale, merely behavioural adjustments to cope with or to change how one interacts with capitalism.

Why is it that critiques of liberal capitalism still assume the posture of individualism? Though capitalism and individualism both constitute part of the water that envelopes us, the tensions inherent to capitalism - the difference between the haves and have-nots, the injustices of uneven distribution, the stratification of a nominally meritocratic society based on circumstances of birth, are more easily laid bare than the flaws of individualism.

At the core of individualism is the belief that the individual has agency. That belief in  absolute agency lends itself to the opinion that the shortcomings of individualism are merely the consequence of flawed individuals. The swathes of adolescents who report having no friends in real life, rising burnout figures, and narcissistic influencers and their followers are not symptomatic of the drawbacks of individualism, but merely the inevitable and necessary drawback of giving individuals the freedom of choice, including the freedom to make the wrong choice.

We also are raised to believe that that agency extends its influence far beyond the micro-scope. From a young age, we are inundated with messages of the impact of our individual actions; you can save the planet by recycling, not eating meat, or biking to school, your vote counts, maybe you will invent the Next Big Thing and change the world.

These narratives of the far-reaching potential of actions are deeply internalised. The despair of individualism is the dissonance suffered when these beliefs are challenged. Systems thinking reveals the complexity and opaqueness of the mechanisms which influence our life.

If life is a river, its course may not be set, but the rains that feed it are beyond our control.
