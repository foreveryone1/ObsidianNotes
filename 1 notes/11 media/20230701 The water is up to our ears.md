In an oft-quoted commencement speech, David Foster Wallace analogises the invisible self-evidence of water surrounding fish to the realities so obvious we do not actively perceive or discuss them.

This analogy has been leveraged in defence of capitalist liberal democracy and its values in the face of critiques made against it from within its luxuries. Besides the arguments and counterarguments on the Western material abundance in the face of inequality and resource extraction in the Global South, individualism has been the target of countless critiques, yet it enjoys an unassailable position.

One can point out the erosion of reproductive and trans rights, but these attacks often operate within the liberal individualist framework - the right for an individual to deny service based on his or her beliefs, the right of an unborn individual to live, it is a debate on which liberties take primacy, not a dispute about the existence of said liberties. The omnipresence of debates on the rights of the individual, from vaccines, to fifteen minute city furore, to gun control, in media and politics reflect the hold of individualism on contemporary thinking.

However, we do not take to the water surrounding us as well as the fish in the analogy. A growing unease with the excesses of individualism can be seen among the young. Social media discourse is inundated with alternatives to individualistic liberal life, from posts advocating "trad life" or "anti-work" sentiments, to mockeries of common individualistic archetypes such as grindset influencers and capitalistic girl bosses.

Yet these alternatives to capitalist thinking remain highly individualistic solutions. A retreat into rural Arcady or a withdrawal from capitalistic striving are both solutions on an individual scale, merely behavioural adjustments to cope or to change how one interacts with capitalism.
