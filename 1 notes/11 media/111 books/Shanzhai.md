> Shanzhai operates through intensive hybridization. In China, Maoism was itself a kind of shanzhai Marxism. In the absence of a working-class and industrial proletariat in China, Maoism undertook a transformation of Marx’s original doctrine. In its ability to hybridize, Chinese communism is now adapting to turbo-capitalism. The Chinese clearly see no contradiction between capitalism and Marxism. Indeed, contradiction is not a Chinese concept. Chinese thought tends more toward “both-and” than “either-or.” Evidently Chinese communism shows itself to be as capable of change as the oeuvre of a great master that is open to constant transformations. It presents itself as a hybrid body. The anti-essentialism of the Chinese thought process allows no fixed ideological definition.

> The Chinese have two different concepts of a copy. Fangzhipin (仿製品) are imitations where the difference from the original is obvious. These are small models or copies that can be purchased in a museum shop, for example. The second concept for a copy is fuzhipin (複製品). They are exact reproductions of the original, which, for the Chinese, are of equal value to the original.

> When the famous Vermeer forger Han van Meegeren exhibited his freely composed imitation, The Supper at Emmaus, in Paris, the painting was declared genuine by all Vermeer experts who considered themselves infallible.
