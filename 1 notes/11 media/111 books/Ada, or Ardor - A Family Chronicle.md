Delightful language, overwhelming erudition and wordplay.

True to the essay embedded within the book, the romantic, exhilarating, novel experiences of youth are magnified and recalled (embellished) with great detail, whereas the longer stretches of absence are glossed over, forgotten, or omitted.

Van, despite being erudite, witty, and charming, comes off as a terrible person (intentionally on Nabokov's part?).

Despite the façade he presents to us, as the one writing the journal, the curtain is pulled back at moments.

- The impulsive duels where he loses
- How he cowers and shies from paternal confrontation
- The hypocrisy of his overwhelming jealousy and possessiveness despite them indulging in the same behaviour ('adultery' / allegedly purely physical encounters to satisfy an urge)

Time as man perceives it:
One is instantly transported to 'the past', but not every moment of the past, only the standout moments that colour one's experiences.

> Our modest Present is, then, the time span that one is directly and actually aware of, with the lingering freshness of the Past still perceived as part of the nowness. In regard to everyday life and the habitual comfort of the body (reasonably healthy, reasonably strong, breathing the green breeze, relishing the aftertaste of the most exquisite food in the world—a boiled egg), it does not matter that we can never enjoy the true Present, which is an instant of zero duration, represented by a rich smudge, as the dimensionless point of geometry is by a sizable dot in printer’s ink on palpable paper.

> The Past, then, is a constant accumulation of images. It can be easily contemplated and listened to, tested and tasted at random, so that it ceases to mean the orderly alternation of linked events that it does in the large theoretical sense.
> We have suggested earlier that the dim intervals between the dark beats have the feel of the texture of Time. The same, more vaguely, applies to the impressions received from perceiving the gaps of unremembered or “neutral” time between vivid events. I happen to remember in terms of color (grayish blue, purple, reddish gray) my three farewell lectures—public lectures—on Mr. Bergson’s Time at a great university a few months ago. I recall less clearly, and indeed am able to suppress in my mind completely, the six-day intervals between blue and purple and between purple and gray.

The future doesn't exist.
