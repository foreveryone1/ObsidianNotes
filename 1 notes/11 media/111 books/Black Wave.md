notes:: 1979 was the point where a negative circle turned into a depressing spiral -  the iranian regime was installed by means of a coalition of leftists, secular muslims, nationalists, and the ultra religious, and the ultra religious took all the spoils and gunned for the prime position of 'leader of the muslim world' - saudi arabia suffered a humiliation in mecca just as iran was calling their position as steward of the holy cities in question, leading them to double down on the cooperation with the wahhabis and led to them funding regressive islam all across the world - the war in afghanistan was the first modern war with a large zealot volunteer army, and paired with that zealous volunteer army was funding and paramilitary structures which would stick around after the war was over
