Passive resistance
> Nothing so aggravates an earnest person as a passive resistance. If the individual so resisted be of a not inhumane temper, and the resisting one perfectly harmless in his passivity; then, in the better moods of the former, he will endeavor charitably to construe to his imagination what proves impossible to be solved by his judgment. 

Passive resistance, by not interacting with (via opposition) its 'opponent' delegitimises it. The disruption caused by non-participation can be far greater than the disruption caused by opposition, which is often normalised and co-opted by establishment figures.

> To a sensitive being, pity is not seldom pain. And when at last it is perceived that such pity cannot lead to effectual succor, common sense bids the soul rid of it. What I saw that morning persuaded me that the scrivener was the victim of innate and incurable disorder. I might give alms to his body; but his body did not pain him; it was his soul that suffered, and his soul I could not reach.

The rationalisation for a 'maximum empathy'.
