> Stresses or interruptions in the infant–parent relationship lead to permanent alterations in the dopamine systems of the midbrain and prefrontal cortex, disturbances that are implicated in both ADHD and in substance abuse and other addictions. If the prevalence of ADHD and other childhood developmental problems is rising in our society, it is not because of “bad parenting” but because the burgeoning stresses on the parenting environment appear to increase with each successive generation.

> Meaning is found in pursuits that go beyond the self. In our own hearts most of us know that we experience the greatest satisfaction not when we receive or acquire something but when we make an authentic contribution to the well-being of others or to the social good, or when we create something original and beautiful or just something that represents a labor of love. It is no coincidence that addictions arise mostly in cultures that subjugate communal goals, time-honored tradition, and individual creativity to mass production and the accumulation of wealth.

> It is often asserted, cynically, that people who act in kindly ways, without any benefit to themselves, are doing so only to feel good. Neuroscience does not support that view: the brain area that lights up as a person performs an altruistic act is not the circuitry activated by pleasure or by the anticipation of reward.

> the role of the cortex, the brain’s executive part, is more to inhibit than to initiate. Impulses to act are generated in lower brain systems, but the job of the cortex is to censor some and permit others. As a prominent researcher expressed it, it’s not a matter of free will but of “free won’t.”

> “Action has meaning only in relationship,” said the spiritual teacher Jiddu Krishnamurti, “and without understanding relationship, action on any level will only breed conflict. The understanding of relationship is infinitely more important than the search for any plan of action.”

>The natural order in all mammalian cultures, animal or human, is that the young stay under the wings of adults until they themselves reach adulthood. This is how under normal circumstances the human young were reared throughout the course of evolution and history, until very recently. Immature creatures were never meant to bring one another to maturity. They were never meant to look to one another for primary nurturing, modeling, cue giving, or mentoring. They are not equipped to act as one another’s focus of orientation, to give one another a sense of direction or values. The predictable and widespread consequences of what my friend, psychologist Gordon Neufeld, has termed peer orientation are the increasing immaturity, alienation, violence, and precocious sexualization of North American youth.

> The historical correlation between severe dislocation and addiction is strong. Although alcohol consumption and drunkenness on festive occasions was widespread in Europe during the Middle Ages, and although a few people became “inebriates” or “drunkards,” mass alcoholism was not a problem. However, alcoholism gradually spread with the beginnings of free markets after 1500, and eventually became a raging epidemic with the dominance of the free market society after 1800.

> The constant, intrusive, and meaningless mind-whirl that characterizes the way so many of us experience our silent moments is, itself, a form of addiction—and it serves the same purpose. “One of the main tasks of the mind is to fight or remove the emotional pain, which is one of the reasons for its incessant activity, but all it can ever achieve is to cover it up temporarily. In fact, the harder the mind struggles to get rid of the pain, the greater the pain.”14 So writes Eckhart Tolle. Even our 24/7 self-exposure to noise, e-mails, cell phones, TV, Internet chats, media outlets, music downloads, videogames, and nonstop internal and external chatter cannot succeed in drowning out the fearful voices within.

> It seemed to me that I was growing up in a house where love was never in question; it was often affirmed. So I knew I was loved, but it came in shifting, confusing, and unpredictable ways that left me on my guard about it, and always craving it in a simpler, more straightforward form. I felt I had to be crafty to catch it and get some for myself, to pin it down.

> If children today are at greater risk for obesity than those of previous generations, it’s not simply because they’re less physically active as a result of being absorbed in TV or computers. It’s primarily because under ordinary peacetime conditions there has never before been a generation so stressed and so starved of nurturing adult relationships.

> The thinking parts of the brain go on furlough. In a brain-imaging study conducted at the University of Münster, Germany, scientists found “reduced activation in brain areas associated with working memory and reasoning and, on the other hand, increased activation in areas involved in processing of emotions,” when even ordinary consumers were engaged in choosing between different brand names of a given product.16 Under logo capitalism, it turns out, the vaunted “market forces” are largely unconscious—a feature of addiction that advertising agencies well understand.

> For these reasons, adoption studies cannot decide questions of generic inheritance. Any woman who has to give up her baby for adoption is, by definition, a stressed woman. She is stressed not just because she knows she’ll be separated from her baby but primarily because if she wasn’t stressed in the first place, she would never have had to consider giving up her child: the pregnancy was unwanted or the mother was poor, single, or in a bad relationship; or she was an immature teenager who conceived involuntarily or was a drug user or was raped or confronted by some other adversity.

> Women who were pregnant at the time of the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks and who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of witnessing the disaster passed on their stress effects to their newborns. At one year of age these infants had abnormal levels of the stress hormone cortisol. We might wonder if this were not a postnatal effect of the mother’s PTSD.

> They are affected by body language: tension in the arms that hold them, tone of voice, joyful or despondent facial expressions, and, yes, the size of the pupils. In a very real sense, the parent’s brain programs the infant’s, and this is why stressed parents will often rear children whose stress apparatus also runs in high gear, no matter how much they love their child and no matter that they strive to do their best.

> Why did Nature make the mammalian opioid system responsible for our reactions to both physical and emotional pain? For a very good reason: the complete helplessness of the young mammal and its absolute dependence on nurturing adults. Physical pain is a danger alarm: if a child wakes up with a tummy ache, her ACC goes into overdrive, and she’ll give every possible signal to call her caregivers promptly to her side. For the infant mammal, emotional pain is an equally essential warning: it alerts us to the danger of separation from those we depend on for our very lives. Feeling this emotional pain triggers infant behaviors—ultrasonic vocalization in rat pups, pitiful crying in human babies—designed to bring the parent back.

> Bruce Alexander, a psychologist at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, points out the obvious: laboratory animals in particular can be induced into addiction because they live under unnatural circumstances of captivity and stress.

> According to a U.S. national survey, the highest rate of dependence after any use is for tobacco: 32 percent of people who used nicotine even once went on to long-term habitual use. For alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine the rate is about 15 percent, and for heroin the rate is 23 percent.

> Clearly, if drugs by themselves could cause addiction, we would not be safe offering narcotics to anyone. Medical evidence has repeatedly shown that opioids prescribed for cancer pain, even for long periods of time, do not lead to addiction except in a minority of susceptible people.

> Addiction is passion’s dark simulacrum and, to the naive observer, its perfect mimic. It resembles passion in its urgency and in the promise of fulfillment, but its gifts are illusory. It’s a black hole. The more you offer it, the more it demands. Unlike passion, its alchemy does not create new elements from old. It only degrades what it touches and turns it into something less, something cheaper.

> Addictions, even as they resemble normal human yearnings, are more about desire than attainment. In the addicted mode, the emotional charge is in the pursuit and the acquisition of the desired object, not in the possession and enjoyment of it. The greatest pleasure is in the momentary satisfaction of yearning.

> Human beings want not only to survive, but also to live. We long to experience life in all its vividness, with full, untrammeled emotion. Adults envy the openhearted and open-minded explorations of children; seeing their joy and curiosity, we pine for our own lost capacity for wide-eyed wonder. Boredom, rooted in a fundamental discomfort with the self, is one of the least tolerable mental states.

> just didn’t know what to do with myself. It felt empty.” A sense of deficient emptiness pervades our entire culture. The drug addict is more painfully conscious of this void than most people and has limited means of escaping it. The rest of us find other ways of suppressing our fear of emptiness or of distracting ourselves from it. When we have nothing to occupy our minds, bad memories, troubling anxieties, unease, or the nagging mental stupor we call boredom can arise.

> “Okay,” I say, reviewing his chart. “Your father died of heart disease. Your brother died of heart disease. You’re a heavy smoker. You have a history of endocarditis from IV drug use. I’m treating you for cardiac failure, and even now your legs are swollen because your heart isn’t pumping efficiently. Your HIV is controlled by strong medications and, with your hep C, your liver is just hanging in there. But you still keep injecting. And you’re asking me what you should do. What’s wrong with this picture?” “I was hoping you’d say that,” Allan replies. “You need to tell me I’m a fucking retard. It’s the only way I learn.” “Okay,” I oblige. “You’re a fucking retard.” “Thanks, Doc.”
