Cows are typically fed using non-irrigated fodder and pasture. The water 'consumed' by cows is taken from, and reintroduced to the water cycle, in contrast to water that is irrigated, which takes from groundwater.

As meat is a 'nutrient concentrator' it provides more nutrients per litre of water consumed.

The food cows receive and the vast majority of the land cows occupy would otherwise go unused, as they aren't fit for human edible cultivation.

Think of the mountainous pastures of the alps or the arid grasslands of the prairies.

Besides non-edible crops, 2.8 kg of human-edible food is consumed per kg of beef, which isn't that much if you consider the relative nutrient densities.

Livestock also makes the agricultural loop more efficient by turning waste products into nutrients.

## Western-meat-production-is-efficient
Counterpoint: [Global-statistics-matter](#Global-statistics-matter)

Meat is produced much more efficiently in the west than in developing countries. Reducing the meat consumption of someone living in the west is proportionally less impactful than reducing the meat consumption of someone in a developing country.

## Cows-dont-add-to-the-carbon-cycle
Counterpoint: [Environmental-effects](#Environmental-effects)

It is true that cows contribute methane to the carbon cycle, however the cellulose and other starches they consume were already present in the atmosphere in the form of CO2, which plants capture through photosynthesis.

Contrast this with fossil fuels, which release sequestered carbon.

Per capita, 74 kg of food go to waste a year. Isn't this a more pertinent concern?

The green water used for growing pasture can be used instead to grow human-edible crops.

It could mean less water being drawn from the ground for irrigation, if the water that falls on pasture and fodders crops were to instead be used for plant-based agriculture.

In addition, in natural conditions, nitrogen rich waste water (urine and manure contaminated water) can be reintegrated into the water cycle. Due to the realities of industrial agriculture this isn't the case; instead of a roaming herd that spreads the waste water, [cows are concentrated in feedlots](https://agrilife.org/tammi/files/2014/04/Sweeten.pdf). This leads to [deadzones due to nutrient run-off](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-3372-3_17).

I have unfortunately not found any studies that provide a clear breakdown in the contribution of livestock and plant-agriculture to nutrient runoffs.

Finally, rain water that is utilised for agricultural purposes is [no longer suitable for replenishment of aquifers](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es1038358).

> Grazing systems supply about 9 percent of the world's production of beef and about 30 percent of the world's production of sheep and goat meat

This suggests that most of the beef produced in the world is derived from cattle that are partially or wholly fed on crops. While this does include waste products, such as husks and stems, the fact remains that 1/3 of the land dedicated to livestock is arable land which could be used for human-edible crops.

In addition, fodder crops such as alfalfa are often [irrigated](https://extension.unr.edu/publication.aspx?PubID=2575#:~:text=Amount%20of%20water%20to%20apply,every%20ton%20of%20hay%20produced.&text=By%20early%20June%2C%20this%20can,as%202.0%20inches%20per%20week.), (partially) negating the point made in [Green-water-usage](#Green-water-usage).

Regardless of apparent nutrient balance differences, 2.8 kilograms of human edible food is consumed to create a kilogram of beef, in addition to the non human edible food grown on land that could be used for human-edible food. This represents an inefficiency, which would be exacerbated if one includes the percentage of fodder grown on land viable for growing human-edible food.

## Global-statistics-matter
See: [Western-meat-production-is-efficient](#Western-meat-production-is-efficient)

The inefficiencies of developing countries do impact us due to global trade.

Brazil is the world's [largest beef exporter](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/50/31770), and importers also include Western countries.

When we eat meat from, for example, Brazil we're not just eating inefficient beef, but we're also adding the cost of global transportation to that beef.

## Environmental-effects

Despite the carbon already being in the environment, turning CO2 to methane is still a net increase in the *warming effect* due to its high [GWP](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials).

In addition, intensive grazing can lead to [soil degradation](http://www.uky.edu/Ag/Agronomy/Extension/ssnv/ssvl182.htm) and [decreased biodiversity](https://sci-hub.st/https://doi.org/10.4141/P06-114) (Note: the study suggests that a moderate level of grazing is *beneficial* to soil biodiversity, perhaps because the land was grazed in a smilar manner by natural megafauna prior to human agriculture in the region).

In [developing countries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112715003394) *and* [developed countries](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2002.01199.x), important carbon sinks *are* being cleared through burning/cutting forest and clearing marshlands, either intentionally, to increase the amount of 'productive land' or inadvertently through land management strategies that damage surrounding wild areas.

## Multiple-issues-can-be-handled-at-once
see: [Reducing-food-waste-is-more-important](#Reducing-food-waste-is-more-important)

Food waste and meat consumption can both be reduced through policy and awareness, in fact, the same awareness pushes can be applied to both concerns.

The author presents a false dichotomy by suggesting that the urgence of one dilemma is so great that the other issue is irrelevant.
