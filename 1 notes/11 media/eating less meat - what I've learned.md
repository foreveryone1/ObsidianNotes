Cows are typically fed using non-irrigated fodder and pasture. The water 'consumed' by cows is taken from, and reintroduced to the water cycle, in contrast to water that is irrigated, which takes from groundwater.

As meat is a 'nutrient concentrator' it provides more nutrients per litre of water consumed.

The food cows receive and the land cows occupy would otherwise go unused.

Think of the mountainous pastures of the alps or the arid grasslands of the prairies.

Livestock also makes the agricultural loop more efficient by turning waste products into nutrients.

Meat is produced much more efficiently in the west than in developing countries. Reducing the meat consumption of a someone living in the west is proportionally less impactful than reducing the meat consumption of someone in a developing country.

Counterpoint: [Environmental-effects](#Environmental-effects)

It is true that cows contribute methane to the carbon cycle, however the cellulose and other starches they consume was already present in the atmosphere In the form of CO2.

Contrast this with fossil fuels, which release sequestered carbon.

## Reducing-food-waste-is-more-important
Per capita, 74 kg of food go to waste a year. Isn't this a more pertinent concern?

The green water used for growing pasture can be used instead to grow human-edible crops.

It could mean less water being drawn from the ground for irrigation, where we instead use.

In addition, nitrogen rich waste water (urine and manure contaminated water), in natural conditions, can be reintegrated into the water cycle. Due to the realities of industrial agriculture this isn't the case.

Instead of a roaming herd that spreads the waste water, cows are concentrated in one place. This leads to deadzones due to nutrient run-off. [Although the use of fertiliser also contributes to the deadzones created.]

> Grazing systems supply about 9 percent of the world's production of beef and about 30 percent of the world's production of sheep and goat meat

This suggests that most of the beef produced in the world is derived from cattle that are partially or wholly fed on crops. While this does include waste products, such as husks and stems, the fact remains that 1/3 of the land dedicated to livestock is arable land which could be used for human purposes.

The fact also remains that 2.8 kilograms of human edible food is consumed to create a kilogram of beef, in addition to the non human edible food grown on land that could be eaten by humans.

The inefficiencies of developing countries do impact us due to global trade.

Brazil is the world's [largest beef exporter](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/50/31770), including to Western countries.

When we eat meat from Brazil we're not just eating inefficient beef, but we're also adding the cost of global transportation to that beef.

Despite the carbon already being in the environment, turning CO2 to methane is still a net increase in the *warming effect* due to its high [GWP](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials).

In addition, intensive grazing leads to soil depletion and decreased biodiversity. In developing countries, important carbon sinks *are* being cleared through burning/cutting forest and clearing marshlands.
