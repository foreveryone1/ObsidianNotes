Cows are typically fed using non-irrigated fodder and pasture. The water 'consumed' by cows is taken from, and reintroduced to the water cycle, in contrast to water that is irrigated, which takes from groundwater.

As meat is a 'nutrient concentrator' it provides more nutrients per litre of water consumed.

## Cows upcycle waste
The food cows receive and the land cows occupy would otherwise go unused.

Think of the mountainous pastures of the alps or the arid grasslands of the prairies.

Livestock also makes the agricultural loop more efficient by turning waste products into nutrients.

## Western meat production is efficient
Meat is produced much more efficiently in the west than in developing countries. Reducing the meat consumption of a someone living in the west is proportionally less impactful than reducing the meat consumption of someone in a developing country.

## Cows don't add to the carbon cycle
It is true that cows contribute methane to the carbon cycle, however the cellulose and other starches they consume was already present in the atmosphere In the form of CO2.

Contrast this with fossil fuels, which release sequestered carbon.

## Reducing food waste is more important

The green water used for growing pasture can be used instead to grow human-edible crops.

It could mean less water being drawn from the ground for irrigation, where we instead use.

In addition, nitrogen rich waste water (urine and manure contaminated water_, in natural conditions, can be reintegrated into the water cycle. Due to the realities of industrial agriculture this isn't the case.

Instead of a roaming herd that spreads the waste water, cows are concentrated in one place. This leads to
