In the dinosaur valley a gigantic diplodocus rests, skin leathery and cracked. Sitting on a nest. The creature, ancient and wizened, can speak telepathically, although it is more pleased to speak in its true tongue.

You can catch a glimpse of the nest it protects, eggs with an amethyst iridescent sheen (iriserende ametystkleur)

All of the dinosaurs in this valley descend from her, supposedly.

Some of her offspring have grown rebellious / feral.

It tells you of egg thieves that have taken one of her precious eggs, and they hatch so slowly, so it pains her to lose them

retrieve the egg for a reward

or steal an egg?
