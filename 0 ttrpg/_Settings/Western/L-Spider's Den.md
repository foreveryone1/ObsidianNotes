Trapdoor spider with a massive trapdoor

- entrance
- room of husks
- some "cocoons" have been cut opened (always when dessecated)
- deeper within mutilated skeletons are visible, with hairy tumorous growths on them
- captured knights of osvaldo, if freed they will cooperate with the party and remember this favour
