### Background: Hermit
The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.

Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.

## Racial Features
- Lucky.
	- When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

- Brave.
	- You have advantage on saving throws against being [[0 ttrpg/Resources/Conditions/Frightened|Frightened]].

- Halfling Nimbleness.
	- You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.


- Silent Speech.
	- You can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time.


## Feats

Fighting Initiate (TCE p80)

## Class Features

### Magical Tinkering (TCE p9) 5 objects
At 1st level, you learn how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have [thieves' tools](https://5e.tools/items.html#thieves'%20tools_phb) or [artisan's tools](https://5e.tools/items.html#artisan's%20tools_phb) in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

-   The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
-   Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
-   The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
-   A static visual effect appears on one of the object's surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object).

### Spellcasting (PHB 51)
Prepared Caster

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

### Infuse Item (3 infusions)
6 infusions known

- [x] **Returning Weapon**
	- This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it returns to the wielder's hand immediately after it is used to make a ranged attack.
- [ ] **Repeating Shot**
	- This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it when it's used to make a ranged attack, and it ignores the loading property if it has it.  
		If the weapon lacks ammunition, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when the wielder makes a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.
- [ ] **Enhanced Defence**
	- A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wearing (armor) or wielding (shield) the infused item.  The bonus increases to +2 when you reach 10th level in this class.
- [ ] **Replicate Magic Item: Cap of Water-Breathing**
	- While wearing this cap underwater, you can speak its command word as an action to create a bubble of air around your head. It allows you to breathe normally underwater. This bubble stays with you until you speak the command word again, the cap is removed, or you are no longer underwater.
- [x] **Boots of the Winding Path**
	- While wearing these boots, a creature can teleport up to 15 feet as a bonus action to an unoccupied space the creature can see. The creature must have occupied that space at some point during the current turn.
- [x] **Repulsion Shield**
	- A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wielding this shield.  
		The shield has 4 charges. While holding it, the wielder can use a reaction immediately after being hit by a melee attack to expend 1 of the shield's charges and push the attacker up to 15 feet away. The shield regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

### Battle Smith
Tool Proficiency
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

Battle Smith Spells
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Battle Smith Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

Battle Smith Spells

| Artificer Level | Spell                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 3rd             | heroism, shield                   |
| 5th             | branding smite, warding bond      |
| 9th             | aura of vitality, conjure barrage |
| 13th            | aura of purity, fire shield       |
| 17th            | banishing smite, mass cure wounds |

Battle Ready

When you reach 3rd level, your combat training and your experiments with magic have paid off in two ways:
`    You gain proficiency with martial weapons.`
`When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls`

Steel Defender

In combat, the defender shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the defender can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The steel defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel defender if you have your smith's tools with you. If you already have a steel defender from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The defender also perishes if you die.

### The Right Tool for the Job
At 3rd level, you learn how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

### Artificer Specialist Feature
Extra Attack

### Tool Expertise
Starting at 6th level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.
