## Entrance
The dungeon seems to be a massive monumental construction, carved straight out of the mountain it is constructed on.

## Abandoned battlefield
There are signs of violence etching and tarnishing the ground. Blastmarks are present throughout, and in some places, the ground is still frozen permanently.

Possible to find equipment to borrow / steal

## Gas swamps
a foul bubbling mess
the mud is difficult to trudge through at best

## Village of sanga
the whole village seems to be windswept
pockmarks and nicks seem to mark every building
two houses stand opposite eachother atthe end of the village

## floodland
a vast still plain
sometimes glimpses of a young woman can be had, darting across the water
when looking better at her, you now realise she is walking on the hands of the drowned, who hold her up

## mirror room
The carved walls open up to a large ballroom, with a vast mirror on one side
the mirror creature seems to guard a cluster of redberries, in addition to the 
mirror shard

The mirror shard is fragment of glass that can be placed. Attacks can be made from the mirror shard instead of from your person, and you can swap places with the mirror shard. (At the end of next person's turn.)

## shrine of memory
[Locksley]

It seems like an abandoned manor
there is a small swingset beside the house, dilapidated and broken
on the bottom of the seat is a little arm charm **loss**
the living room seems to contain the scattered remains of a party, there is a roughly drawn sketch of the host wearing a dunce cap **shame**
one of the wardrobes contains a fragment of a letter, an invitation to a royal court, the spot where he was supposed to mark his stamp on it is blank

drop: shackle of the past

## black feathers
a group of rebels that want to undermine the current system of summer and winter
aan het hoofd van hun organisatie is de banneling
als de party genoeg hun vertrouwen kan winnen door goede daden te verrichten zullen zij aan hun kant strijden

## Huvir, the sire
notes on how to maximise his power by using the four humours

blood - himself
gele gal - raging berserker
phlegm - the druid
zwarte gal - sadness monster

## Makar
Chauntea druid turned vampire
petrified trees surround him, seemingly to ward you off
notably, the spikes and the thorns of the trees are pointed inwards, not outwards

makar is bound to a stone bed by vast thorns
he is constantly chanting a prayer to chauntea

Chauntea's blessing
quiver
eens per combat

voor 1 turn
pijlen exploderen, doen d8+wis splash damage (ongeacht of ze raken of niet)
healen allies voor hetzelfde

## frosty area


## desert area

## prison
De banneling, leider van de Zwarte Veren
wou het systeem overwerpen
vertelt je hoe je het strijdveld moet bereiken van zomer en winter

mond geboeid, handen en voeten geboeid
bewaakt door zowel winter en zomer

## thunder bird's nest
non-violent solution to the conflict between the brothers
the top of the bird's nest is inhabited by an angry creature that has settled into the nest
a vague glimpse of shining rock can be seen below


## Tumnus
