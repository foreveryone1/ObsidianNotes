**Estimated time exercising: 45 minutes**
Perform the exercises left to right, with no breaks in between exercises [1 circuit]
Take a 3 minute break after each circuit
Do 5 circuits
Aim to exercise 4-5 times a week
alternate between **[A]** and **[B]** and the listed pushup variants

Variants of the exercise are listed below
When you jump up to a more intense exercise it is normal to lower the amount performed
Increment until you are back up to the goal number, maintain a few days to see if its sustainable injury-wise, increment again
When building up to a higher number you can 'fill in the deficit' with an easier variant, for example if you're doing 7 weighted pullups, you can add one negative weighted pullup to build up towards 8
