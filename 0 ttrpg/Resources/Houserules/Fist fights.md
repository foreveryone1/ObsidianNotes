Fistfight rules

Roll 8d6, this will be the number the participants will try to match.

Participants roll a number of times equal to their attack bonus for unarmed strikes. Each roll is added to their total, which the participants must try to get as close as possible to the target number without exceeding it. Exceeding the total at the end of your final turn results in a loss.

Participants take turn rolling their die, which may be any die between a d4 and a d20.

Participants can choose to add or subtract their Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution modifier to their die roll. A participant's total always increases by at least 1 after a die roll. The choice of attribute score used also determines which gambits are available.


Rounds, turn order, risk, and gambits
\- In the first round, the challenger goes first. If there is no clear challenger, roll initiative, the highest roll goes last.
\- The larger a die is,  the riskier it is. In rounds after the first, the participant who takes the least risk goes first. In the event of a tie, the order from the previous round is maintained.
\- With each roll a participant may choose a minor gambit.
\- The participant that took the most risk in the previous round may choose to forgo rolling and instead make a greater gambit. If the participants took an equal amount of risk, nobody may make a greater gambit.
\- In the round immediately after a greater gambit was used, no greater gambit can be taken.

Some gambits have a restriction to them. If a gambit mentions an attribute score, a participant must have added or subtracted your attribute score to their die roll that round to use it.
