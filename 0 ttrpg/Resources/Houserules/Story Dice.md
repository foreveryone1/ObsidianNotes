## Basic Mechanic
A number of story dice equal to the number of players plus one is always present in the game.

When a player expends a story die, that story die is transferred to the dungeon master. Inversely, the DM can expend a story die, which is then transferred to the players' pool of story dice.

The dungeon master adjudicates when a story die can be used. Typically, story dice cannot effect situations where the player expending a story die has no influence over the outcome of a situation.

Using a story die to force an opponent to reroll a critical strike is possible, but using a story die to make the dungeon master reroll the outcome of an event miles away isn't possible, barring narrative justification.

```note
Spending a story die is inherently a trade-off, because it provides the opportunity for an opponent to use one at a later moment.

However, if you want to up the risk even more, considering making it clear to players that spending a story die will bring about graver consequences for failing.

## Uses
### Adding to a result
A story die can be expended to roll a d6, and adding that to the result.
### Rerolling
A story die can be expended to roll a d20 again, using that result. If a roll was made with advantage or disadvantage, the one who spent the story die may choose which result the newly rolled die replaces. Afterwards, the rules of advantage or disadvantage are applied to choose between the two results. 

### Exploiting a vulnerability
When a character rolls a natural one in combat or when making a check in a volatile situation, a story die can be expended to escalate the degree of failure.

For example, a natural one on attack can lead to a reaction counter-attack, and a natural one while climbing a cliff can lead to a devastating fall, **if** the dungeon master expends a story die.
