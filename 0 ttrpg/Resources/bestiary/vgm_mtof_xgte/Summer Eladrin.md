## Summer Eladrin
*To be not just ruled by emotions, but physically changed by them? Better to have no emotions at all.*— Mordenkainen***Summer Eladrin.*** When they are angered, eladrin enter the season of summer, a burning, tempestuous state that transforms them into aggressive warriors eager to vent their wrath. Their magic responds to their fury and amplifies their fighting ability, which helps them move with astonishing quickness and strike with terrible force.
***Eladrin.*** Eladrin dwell in the verdant splendor of the Feywild. They are related to the elves found on the Material Plane, and resemble them in both their love of beauty and the value they place on personal freedom. But where other elves can temper their wild impulses, eladrin are creatures ruled by emotion—and because of their unique magical nature, they undergo physical changes to match their changes in temperament.
The eladrin have spent centuries in the Feywild, and most of them have become #fey ,  creatures as a result. Some of them are still humanoid, similar in that respect to their other elven kin. The eladrin presented here are of the #fey ,  variety.
***Creatures of Passion.*** The magic flowing through eladrin responds to their emotional state by transforming them into different seasonal aspects, with behaviors and capabilities that change with their forms. Some eladrin might remain in a particular aspect for years, while others run through the emotional spectrum each week.
***Lovers of Beauty.*** Regardless of the aspect they express, eladrin love beauty and surround themselves with lovely things. Eladrin try to possess any objects they find striking. They might seek to own a painting, a statue, or a glittering jewel. When they encounter people of comely form or luminous spirit, they use their magic to delight those folk or, in the case of evil eladrin, to abduct them.
***Changeable Nature.*** Whenever one of the eladrin presented here finishes a long rest, it can associate itself with a different season, provided it isn't incapacitated. When the eladrin makes this change, it uses the stat block of the new season, rather than its old stat block. Any damage the eladrin sustained in its original form applies to the new form, as do any conditions or other ongoing effects affecting it.
