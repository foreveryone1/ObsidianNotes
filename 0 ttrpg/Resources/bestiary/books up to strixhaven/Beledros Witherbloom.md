>***Decaying Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).*** Beledros exhales decaying energy in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 39 (6d12) necrotic damage and 39 (6d12) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

>***Miasmal Flow.*** Beledros becomes a swirling cloud of green mist and can move up to half her flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks, then resumes her true form.

If she moves through a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn. If Beledros ends this move inside an object, she takes 5 (1d10) force damage and is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space.  
>

>- **Claw.** Beledros makes one Claw attack.
>- **Miasmal Flow (Costs 2 Actions).** Beledros uses Miasmal Flow.
>- **Teeming with Life (Costs 3 Actions).** Beledros magically summons 1d4 pest mascots in unoccupied spaces she can see within 60 feet of herself. The pests obey her commands and take their turns immediately after hers. Any creature, other than a pest, takes 9 (2d8) poison damage if it starts its turn within 5 feet of one or more of these pests. When one of these pests drops to 0 hit points, Beledros regains 9 hit points. These pests disappear after 10 minutes, when Beledros dies, or when she uses this action again.

## Beledros Witherbloom

The dragon Beledros masters the intertwined magic of life and death. Her power taps into the life force flowing through living things and the natural world. She manipulates that energy to give healing and life or to bring death and decay. Her mastery of this magic sustains her own life force even without the sustenance of food, drink, or even air.

She founded Witherbloom College to pass on her understanding of the natural cycle. She hoped to create generations of stewards who would use her teachings to defend nature and help others. In keeping with the dichotomous nature of her philosophy and magic, she views the more dangerous aspects of nature, including the inevitability of death and decay, as natural and integral parts of existence.
