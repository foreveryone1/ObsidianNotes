## First-Year Student

A student who has not yet chosen one of Strixhaven's five mystic colleges is referred to as a first-year student, after the one year of basic curriculum that most students must complete before selecting their school. These beginner students are taught by faculty from all of Strixhaven's colleges, learning rudimentary magic as they acclimate to the university's environment. Once a student has selected a college, they trade their plain gray first-year uniforms for the trappings of their chosen school and begin honing—or even replacing—the magic they learned in their initial year with other skills.
