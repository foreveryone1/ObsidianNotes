## Kettlesteam the Kenku

Kettlesteam the kenku snoops around the carnival under the cover of a disguise self spell, looking to cause trouble. The kenku has stolen the voice of a human mime named Candlefoot (see " Hall of Illusions " earlier in the chapter). While this prize remains in her possession, Kettlesteam can speak clearly in Candlefoot's soft, silky voice.
