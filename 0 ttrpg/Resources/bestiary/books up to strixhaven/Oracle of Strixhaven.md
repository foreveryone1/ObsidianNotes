## Oracle of Strixhaven

Somewhere in the lands beyond Strixhaven's borders lives the Oracle: a wise and accomplished mage, tasked by the Founder Dragons to ensure that the magic of Strixhaven is used to help others and not twisted to evil ends. The one who holds the mantle of the Oracle must not only understand the fundamental truths of magic, but also possess impeccable wisdom and unshakable virtue.

The current Oracle is an elderly human named Jadzi. A graduate of Quandrix College, Jadzi has since expanded her studies to encompass all disciplines of spellcasting, tempering the mathematical abstractions she wielded at Strixhaven with benevolent divination and a return to the basics of magic itself.
