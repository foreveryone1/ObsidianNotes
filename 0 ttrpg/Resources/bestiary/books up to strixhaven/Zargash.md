>***Animate Corpse (1/Day).*** Zargash targets the lifeless corpse of one Humanoid he can see within 30 feet of him and commands it to rise, transforming it into a zombie under his control. The zombie takes its turn immediately after Zargash. Animating the zombie requires Zargash's concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). The zombie reverts to an inanimate corpse after 10 minutes, when it drops to 0 hit points, or when Zargash's concentration ends.

## Zargash

Zargash worships Orcus, the Demon Prince of Undeath, who has promised to transform Zargash into a vampire after a lifetime of faithful service. For a living priest to worship Orcus is utter folly, but Zargash is twisted beyond any hope of redemption. His hobbies include slaying the living and animating the dead.
