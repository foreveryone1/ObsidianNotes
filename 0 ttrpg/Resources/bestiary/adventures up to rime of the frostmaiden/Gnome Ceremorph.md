## Gnome Ceremorph
Mind flayers, which are described in the Monster Manual, are created through ceremorphosis, a process that begins with the implantation of an illithid tadpole in the brain of a humanoid host. After about seven days in its new home, the tadpole transforms its host into a mind flayer. The new creation typically retains no memory of its previous existence.
For reasons unknown, ceremorphosis can go awry when an illithid tadpole is implanted in the brain of a gnome. This deviation might be due to the quasi-magical nature of gnomes, or simply a facet of how their minds work. When the process is warped only slightly, the mind flayer remains gnome-sized and is called a gnome ceremorph. It retains its knowledge of the Gnomish language while becoming able to speak Deep Speech and Undercommon. It retains fragmented memories of its previous life and previous alignment, not to mention a propensity for invention.
***Laser Pistol.*** A gnome ceremorph often carries a home-built device that functions as a laser pistol (see "Firearms" in the Dungeon Master's Guide). This weapon is powered by an energy cell, which enables the weapon to fire 50 shots. After its last shot is expended, the device becomes inoperable. The energy cell can't be removed without destroying the weapon.
