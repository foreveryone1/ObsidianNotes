### Traits
- Nothing bothers me for long.

- I can party with everyone. No matter the culture, I can find a way to have a good time.
- I'd rather be mining. This is okay; mining is better.
- I think that I will stumble upon great riches if I just keep looking.
- People who don't work with their hands and who live in houses are soft and weak.
- I wish I were more educated. I look up to people who are.
### Ideals
- Generosity: The riches of the earth are to be shared by all. #Good
- Greed: Gems and precious metals, I want them all for myself. #Evil
- Mooch: Property, schmoperty. If I need it, I take and use it. If I don't, I leave it for someone else. #Chaotic
- Boundaries: Everything and everyone has its prescribed place; I respect that and expect others to do the same. #Lawful
- Let it Be: I don't meddle in the affairs of others if I can avoid it. They're none of my business. #Neutral
- Materialist: I want riches to improve my life.

### Bonds
- The people of the mines are my family. I will do anything to protect them.
- A miner saved my life when I was injured and alone. I owe his family a great debt.
- I must behold and preserve the natural beauty of places below the earth.
- Gems hold a special fascination for me, more than gold, land, magic, or power.
- I want to explore new depths and scale new heights.
- Someday I'm going to find the mother lode, then I'll spend the rest of my life in luxury.

### Flaws
- I'm uncomfortable spending time under the open sky. I'd rather be indoors or underground.
- I'm not used to being around other people much and sometimes get grouchy about it.
- Good tools are more reliable than people. In a cave in, I would save a sturdy pick before a stranger.
- I jealously guard my secrets, because I think others will take advantage of me if they learn what I know.
- I am obsessed with getting rich. I always have a scheme brewing for making it big.
