Pushing rolls = rerolling or adding a die to a roll without using an intrinsic class feature from one's self or an ally.

The consequences of failing a pushed roll must be greater than failing an unpushed roll.

Consider using a resource that is exchanged between DM and player, rather than a resource that a player permanently uses.
