Pyroclastic puffins are a colonial creature, like ants and naked mole rats

the queen is the only creature that can lay drone eggs, as well as future queen eggs

workers also lay eggs, viviparously

despite the name they don't create fire themselves, although they do manipulate it > collective fanning of the flames to clear brushland, the smouldering plains are ideal for incubating their eggs

the vagrant mammoth clans would retrieve nesting material as a trial of adulthood
best results was a nest without the death of any birds

in an open and brushy field, they'd erect a totem pole with smouldering herbs that attracted the pyroclastic puffin
a second group would bait the queen with an incense burner

challenge to collect the burning incense


- wandering mammoth clan will tell you the location of the abandoned totems, easy one if you win a game vs them, hard one if you lose
	- one is in the abanoned mammoth sanctuary
	- the other has been captures by Summer mercenaries as a trophy of war
