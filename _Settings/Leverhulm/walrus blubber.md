the Miq tribe lives in ornate frozen houses and tend their flock of woolie ants well

as it is shelter, their houses are often occupied when they move into 

if you do them the favour of clearing out one of the houses so they can get moving, the tribe's leader is willing to create a slave that protects against the salamander's frost breath

one slot of walrus blubber is one protection
