If you've been on the Obsidian Members Group discord, you've probably seen me *copiously* documenting the development process for this plug-in.

Now that it's been approved for the Community Plugins list, I felt it was an opportune moment to share this plugin on the forums!

Obsidian Tabs lets you open new documents [ctrl+click in the file explorer] in 'tabs'.

This plugin is made for use with the Maximise Pane plugin and the Pane Relief plugin to allow quick maximising and swapping of the active pane.

In addition, this plugin lets the user have multiple tabbed windows at the same time [see [documentation](https://github.com/gitobsidiantutorial/obsidian-tabs/blob/main/README.md) on how to achieve this.]

Install the plugin manually fromt the [releases tab of the github repo](https://github.com/gitobsidiantutorial/obsidian-tabs), or install it from the Community Plugins list!

This plugin may not play well with certain themes, especially ones with sliding panes CSS integrated. Feel free to request a compatch through [github issues](https://github.com/gitobsidiantutorial/obsidian-tabs/issues) if something doesn't work, or looks off. If a theme is working well, you're also encouraged to notify me on github, so I can update the compatbility list!
